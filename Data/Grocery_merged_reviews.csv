stephanie arnaud,US,5 days agoVerified,"The best Beef we've ever had! Thank you Reserve MeatsI had ordered the select cuts box from reserve meats, when it arrived it wasn't exactly what i had expected so I called reserve meats and talked to Joe. The butcher/packager they hired had screwed up a lot of their orders  so they were in the process of fixing that problem. Joe felt awful about the mix-ups and insisted on making it right with us even though I wasn't asking for anything at all. The quality is amazing, My cowboy husband says its the best tasting meat he has eaten and is now our go-to for red meat. I had read another review and do not agree with the statement of the amount of fat in the ground meat. (there was less left than the 80/20 grass fed we tried) I believe if people contacted businesses with their issues instead of being so mean and impersonal by posting harsh statements, they would realize we are all human and mistakes happen. This company is doing their best to provide healthier food for more people at affordable prices. The fat from Wagu is actually good, healthy fat equivalent to Olive oil. I want to thank Joe for his understanding, kindness and generosity and Reserve Meats for making this high quality healthy meat available to the Azure community.

Six days went by and I called again, had to press 1 to receive a call back and 3 hrs later I got a call. The agent said my account had been credited for the amount 2 days prior but I should have been contacted. I did receive a credit but the customer service process was time consuming and non-apologetic for the experience. Lots of work to track down my money!Date of experience: December 13, 2024",3,Grocery

Noriko,US,7 days agoVerified,"Disappointing Service and Concerns Over Expiration DatesNormally, I am quite happy with the service I have received, even though some items may not show up from time to time. However, I was not at all satisfied with the last order because one box, containing 6 items, was missing. I sent an email and also made a phone call requesting a refund, but no call was returned. It took a week to receive an email asking if I had contacted the coordinator.Additionally, I had a question about an item expiring in a month, which left me in a bind as I couldn’t buy from somewhere else until I received an answer. The response I received was, ""Our policy is that anything with at least 2 weeks until the best by date will be sent out. This is not something that we would typically issue a credit for, and we cannot accept returns on food items.""That response made me reconsider ordering a 25lb bag, as freshness is very important to me. If that is your policy, I would need to see expiration information on the website so I can avoid purchasing products I won’t be able to use before the expiration date.Date of experience: December 16, 2024",2,Grocery

WITCHHAVEN APOTHECARY,US,"Jan 5, 2025Verified","I have been a customer of Azure for…I have been a customer of Azure for many years. I volunteer as a drop coordinator along with my husband. We take pride in what we do for other customers of Azures. We have had multiple issues on our drops, not receiving items and items being in another person box etc. Upon phoning Azure and getting a ticket number for a call back. I have not been contacted about our drop issues. I waited days to only be told I missed the deadline. Which is 100% incorrect. As a business owner myself also my husband owns his own business as well. We are fully aware of how to successfully run our businesses. Now that’s been said, not returning calls is a big mistake. Also how to lose customers. Another thing that’s consistently getting worse, is that they will indicate they are out of a product, I will keep it in my cart anyway in hopes they will get it in before our truck leaves the warehouse. The point is that once it’s closed I will start a new order, and upon looking for the item I did not receive they have multiples of the item they did not send me. This is becoming a Azure Standard tradition. I spend a lot of time on the website am pro active to pay very close attention to sales, clearance, and new products along with what’s back in stock. I am on twice a day to check everything. I have also been highly disappointed that they have not cleaned up their website referring to all the discontinued products, they have been there for years and years now. It would be great if they could nix those products and clean it up so customers don’t waste time scrolling. I will continue to work with Azure as I do love there standards and products they use and do the work to make sure things are safe for customers. Overall our drop generates $8000.00 to $14,000 monthly. That’s great for our demographic. Thanks Date of experience: December 13, 2024",4,Grocery

So this is my second rating here that has gone lower to 1 because there was no response to me.I would now appreciate someone from Azure quality department to contact me and explain why this will not be the case in the future OR  change the product description to include the possibility that the product could be up to 50% powder.Date of experience: November 19, 2024",1,Grocery

Before I get an item I usually check to see if there are any in stock. In this case, it said you had over 4000 of them. I didn’t get my item so I went back and checked and it still said you had over 4000 in stock. I did call about it but to me there’s got to be a better way to do this.

Virginia Willems,US,"Jan 4, 2025Verified","Good outweighs the bad, but not by muchMany products arrive in good shape, fresh, and are good products.  With many orders, however, my produce is bad when I get it, and parts of it are unsalvageable.  I’ve had zucchini, onions, garlic, carrots, apples, and pears arrive partially spoiled.  I had debris (trash, in addition to many grains that are not wheat berries) in my last bag of wheat berries, and some of the non food products I’ve ordered have just been less than stellar.  I’m thinking of the dishwashing liquid soap, for example, and the Country Save laundry detergent.  I’ve had yogurt go bad very fast and sardines shipped to me that expired soon after arriving, and I would expect canned goods to have a far out expiration date when they arrive.  The most disappointing experience I have had by far was my November drop when the time was changed five times, including moved to a different day, and some of the times gave zero notice, so that I actually went to my drop three times expecting to get my groceries and found out then that the truck was not there. This was very frustrating, downright maddening.  On a positive note, many items I have ordered have shipped, have arrived in good shape, and have been very good foods and products.  The good has outweighed the bad so far for me (I’ve been a customer for about two years, I think), but not by much, and only because my schedule allows me to be flexible on pick up times.Date of experience: December 13, 2024",4,Grocery

We had trouble recently on a shipped order to get our expedited shipping that they shipped ground, the tracking showing it was shipped ground was not enough, they demanded the label on the box we had thrown away, so we had to find it and send the photo as well.  The person handling the complaint by email tried to tell us we would have to go after UPS and tried to blame UPS yet they were the shipper and shipped it ground, it took three emails to get them to reimburse us the expedited shipping we paid for at the place of the order.  The other complaint is you cannot depend on when the trucked orders will arrive, and they don't care about people who work and have schedules too, instead they send out emails saying to find a friend or someone else to pick up the order.  It used to be where when you checked out with your order you knew when the truck would arrive.  They have gotten too big and now they don't treat the customer as well and just expect everyone to just be available when they say it will arrive.   We work out of town, so that makes it difficult and especially with larger orders that require freezer space and refrigeration.   Date of experience: December 03, 2024",1,Grocery

KD,US,"Jan 4, 2025Verified","First Order with AzureI recently picked up my first ever order with Azure and am very happy. The products are great, the selection is outstanding, my metro has a really good selection of drop points for pick-up, and the prices are pretty good, sometimes fantastic. The one thing I found frustrating was that I put items into my cart and checked out weeks before my shipment. Somehow, a few days prior to the truck leaving for my delivery, many of my items were out of stock. For the perishable items I do understand - Azure wants those to go to their customers before they go bad, so if they have the opportunity to provide those to someone else before my truck leaves they're going to take it. However, for packaged items it seems as if my items should have been ""checked out"" of inventory to me, so to speak, and put on hold for my order. While this was a frustration, I don't think it will keep me from using the service.I look forward to using Azure well into the future and am excited to see new products and developments as the company grows!Date of experience: December 14, 2024",4,Grocery

For this years order for Fitzgerald/Hess I notified FedEx to change delivery address they advised that request needed to come from Hale Groves.  I contacted HG and provided the new address for them to notify FedEx.   I was assured it would be taken care of as it hadn’t been delivered as of yet.   I spoke with my friend only to find out she had not received the order.  I called back HG and then was advised the oranges were already delivered to the previous address and not the new address.    I was disappointed to hear this as I was assured it would be delivered to the new address, same town but different street address.   I expressed my disappointment and asked if something could be done.  I was advised a new order could be sent out but I would have to pay another $35 or so dollars.  Over the years I have purchased quite a few gifts thru HG and thought as a courtesy something could be complimentary sent but this was not the case.  Needless to say I was very disappointed and will think twice about any further orders.Thank you.

James Rodgers,US,5 days agoVerified,"Lack of concern for issues and mistakesWe have been ordering from your company…We have been ordering from your company for a few years.  Last year we tried your bulk grapefruit and were very dissapointed. The grapefruit we get in the grocery store is fresher and stays good longer.  One of the gift boxes we sent was supposed to have 3 grapefruit and only had one.  This year I tries to order on line and kept getting to the point of confirming addresses and delivery dates. I would get the first one done fine and kept freezing up when I tried to do the second address and delivery date.  So I waited and called to talk to a sales person.  I explained to them the problem I was having with the web site.  The apologized but didn't seem very interested in correcting the issue.  So I placed my 2 orders. The second order the delivery date needed to be changed to receive by Christmas.  I asked her twice to make sure that it had been changed.  She assured me it would get there by Christmas.  It DIDN'T@!!@@!@! I called in to make sure the order had been placed and the delivery date had been changed. The delivery date hadn't been changed.  It got there on time according to the old delivery date.  These relatives travel for the holidays. I want the fruit to get there when they are home and can enjoy it.  Luckily they were still home but I was very upset when they didn't have their gift for Christmas or even New Years!!!!The person I talked to when I called to see what was wrong seemed very unconcerned that there was a problem. I realize according to the computer there was no problem but there was.  After explaining the problem and expressing our frustration there was still no apology. When I more firmly told him I wasn't pleased with the service he did finally apologize half heartedly.  I know you must do a huge volume of orders during the holidays.  Mistakes happen.  We didn't complain last year with the poor quality and missing fruit.  The only reason I called in this year was to make sure that the gift would finally arrive.If problems like this occur I would suggest that the personel be more apologetic even if they think the error is the customers. Other businesses sometimes offer a gift/discount coupon/freebee as a goodwill gesture.  I think the thing that most irritated me was the lack of concern that was shown when I mentioned the website issue and the lack of concern with our gift being sent late. We like the product and selection you offer but if we keep having issues we will be forced to look elsewhere.Date of experience: December 09, 2024",3,Grocery

Good Ranchers makes it so convenient to have fresh high quality grass fed and organic meat. As an added bonus, I now spend less on groceries since my meat is always available. The flavor is incredible and even my two 15 year old cats enjoy the meat too! Their coats and energy levels are through the roof. If you ever offered cat food or treats I would like to try it. I have not had the chicken, but will try next time. Also I did not receive my tracking number for my second order. Their customer support was so understanding and gave me that information.

Becky Shepherd,US,"Jan 3, 2025","Shipping costs can be twice as much as the productI love the product but do not like to pay more for shipping than the product costs. I paid $9.75 for the lavender I orders and $9.99 for shipping. I chatted with a CS rep at the time of order. I was told there was nothing that could be done and if I want to save on shipping I should order more product. I was told I should order up to 4 lbs for the $9.99 shipping. I cannot afford to order in bulk nor do I need that much product. I order as needed. I am not willing to pay $20 for a $10 items. Going forward I will order from Amazon where I can get twice the product for almost the same cost and pay no shipping and I get it in 24 to 72 hours instead of 8+ days. The CS rep tried to convince me Amazon increases the price on all their products in order to cover shipping which is not true. We use Amazon fairly regular and even if I paid the monthly fee of $14 per month it would still be cheaper than ordering from Mountain Rose. Unfortunately I will no longer be using Mountain Rose Herbs. Since I'm not a big customer I'm sure they don't care.Date of experience: December 22, 2024",3,Grocery

Lucialina Tavares,US,"Dec 26, 2024","""Disappointing Yarrow Flower Quality from Mountain Rose HerbsAs a dedicated herbalist with over a decade of experience using yarrow flower from various suppliers, I was disheartened by my recent purchase from Mountain Rose Herbs. Traditionally, yarrow flowers present a creamy to light brown hue, accompanied by a strong, distinctive aroma and a notably bitter taste. However, the batch I received was predominantly composed of finely ground green leaves, deviating significantly from the expected characteristics.Mountain Rose Herbs is renowned for its commitment to organic and sustainably sourced botanicals, as evidenced by their extensive certifications and quality control measures.  Their dedication to quality is further demonstrated by their in-house testing facilities, which ensure the identity and purity of their products.  Despite these rigorous standards, the discrepancy in the yarrow flower batch I received raises concerns about consistency and quality control.Date of experience: December 22, 2024",1,Grocery

I like that the country of origin is always specified for each essential oil.  The quality of the oil seems good, though I am not a great expert, but skin reactions and ingestion were not a problem even with medium-aggressive dilution.THE BAD: order processing takes too long before it is handed to the carrier.  In addition, the shipping options were not clearly explained, in my opinion.  The distinction between USPS and the other carrier was not explicit.  In hot summers, fast delivery options must be clear lest the essential oils stay too long in delivery trucks.Maybe I should have given 4 stars rather than 3, but the devil lies in the details.Date of experience: September 05, 2024",3,Grocery

Carolyn,US,"Updated Oct 15, 2024","Quality of the Hydrosols updated review I ordered three different hydrosols from Mountain Rose Herbs. Peppermint, Rose and Cucumber. Every last one of them was rank and rancid.  I was extremely disappointed. I have been ordering from Mountain Rose Herbs for quite some time. And have been a loyal customer, so I was expecting so much more from them. Obviously the hydrosols were very old and had gone rancid, but they still wanted to sell them and I was chosen to unknowingly purchase ad products.The worst part,  is their return policy. Make sure you look at their “return policy before you order.” Why should I have to come out of pocket and pay to return their rancid items? I ordered so much more from them, including essential oils.  Now I am skeptical about everything I ordered, as my order was quite large and as you know, Mountain Rose is not cheap. Though the prices used to be more reasonable, I suppose they will claim inflation cost for the reason their prices have skyrocketed, even more. Don’t have a problem paying for whatever they charge, if I want the product, but at least they can be fair and send quality and fresh products.Update: Received a phone call and message from Mountain Rose and the company was gracious enough to explain that their hydrosols were “steam-distilled pure botanical waters with a much lighter fragrance than most expect” They also do not have essential oils added to them. I was also told that I could return the items, but I realized that this would be quite pricey and not worth the extra expense or trouble. I believe their return policy is written so that the public at large can be protected. Mountain Rose has also given me a “store credit” the amount I have paid for the hydrosols.

My skin is so smooth, better than any store bought lotion has ever done for me. And has cleared up my daughter’s dry skin almost instantly with one application.

"Dan Rockhill, Rockhill Assoc.",US,2 days agoVerified,"Years agoYears ago, the process was simple and friendly. Now that USWM has grown the process has become driven more by corporate interests than previously. It took me a day to try and get my log in accepted as it kept telling me there was problem with the system try later. If they told me my credit card needed the password updated, I would have done it immediately, but that option wasn't clear. What's the reason for two step authorization, like were in the CIA, having to go get my phone for the secret number to back up who I am? I finally placed my order on December 29th. Today is the 11th of January and I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY ORDER. Granted there was snow but hardly enough to cause such a problem. I called USWM to see if they knew FEDEX was taking so long and was put off, no one at Customer Service but a tape message saying leave a number we'll get back to you. I doubt FedEx uses anything but a heated warehouse to store deliveries they will move when they feel like it so what are the chances my order has spoiled.

kevin,US,"Updated Nov 22, 2024Verified","gross gristle found throughout liverwurst packagesthe customer service is friendly, but strangely ""blind"" to their own need for improvement.  for example, although i love the flavor of their liverwurst, it has a HUGE amount of small and medium sized pieces of grizzle in EVERY package, some more than others.  when i pointed out how gross this is, and their need to use finer mesh screens to take these out before packaging and shipping them off, their response is:  no one else complains, and the package(s) i received must be an outlier.  when i asked them to check how many customers order liverwurst only one time (not willing to slog through the gristle), they again reiterated that this simply doesn't happen and that i am the ONLY one who has ever raised this issue with them!  i sent them photos of just how much gristle i have had to spit out or take out of my mouth in just one package as proof.   constantly having to remove gristle should be a cause of concern to their quality control department; instead the implication is that the ""problem"" lies with me and others must swallow or ignore the gristle, so they do not plan to change or improve on their QC at all!  until i find another similar organic company with better gristle screening methods for their liverwurst, i will still order from them......but i won't dare serve it to visiting friends or family members.  in response to your assessment that it is ""only"" naturally occurring hard pieces, what difference does this make if they are literally unchewable?  they should not be in there in the first place. if i knew how to attach a photo i would do so, just to give other customers some idea of the number and size these unscreened ""pieces"" of whatever that i have to spit out of a typical 1lb container.Date of experience: November 04, 2024",3,Grocery

Jas,US,"Apr 17, 2024","I live The Good, The Bad and the UglyI live 1.5 miles from my Walmart. I like ordering as I'm elderly and mostly home confined. They are often faster than promised, or right on time. However, total cost is higher than you expect due to adding driver tips. Recently, I've learned if you consistently select the lowest tip ($4), you get an order delayed email. Meaning you won't get your order, forcing you to cancel. So I no longer order from Walmart. Except for items not in-store, thus are shipped via a shipper.Date of experience: April 08, 2024",2,Grocery

When an order is missing items or otherwise incorrect, the wait time to get through the phone tree is unacceptable. Once you finally manage to talk to a customer service representative, plan for the call to take an unacceptable amount of time as well. Two orders ago ALL of the meat I ordered went missing- olive oil as well. The driver had said he delivered it. I think it was delivered to his trunk to take home, but I am not certain. I had to wait 5 days for a refund. I reordered groceries yesterday. My entire order was delivered somewhere else- not my fault. I now have to wait up to 10 days for a refund. I spent 45 minutes on the phone asking them to resolve it faster with a credit so I could order again. No luck. They kept reading their scripts to me. Even the supervisor I requested read scripts. I can't help but think about families that absolutely cannot wait days for a refund. Every other pick up or delivery service that I have used has corrected mistakes immediately-as they should.

Anonymous,US,"Dec 26, 2024","DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON DELIVERY I placed an order as usual, and as usual, something was wrong. Way wrong this time. The driver canceled the order because she was incompetent and couldn't find us. I was out smoking a cigarette ten minutes before the delivery time scheduled, and when the app said it was on the way. I even stayed outside an extra ten minutes, during which it was canceled. Not even one car passed by, so she never even tried. I then contacted Walmart and asked if I could just come pick it up, and they said no, and I couldn't reorder until the next day. They said they canceled the order but didn't, and it showed pending.The next day, I contacted them again through the chat option, and they said they canceled it and I should get an email. I went around and around with them about the app and refund, not showing the cancelation that took place. The next day, they said the same thing, but again, neither took place. The next day, I contacted them again through chat, trying to get a resolution with no success. Later that day, I got a partial refund, but the app said pending. So I contacted them again, and they said it's pending due to two items being out of stock. What!? Two items I never received on a canceled order. The chat agent that time was either new or could care less because he ended the chat before a resolution or explanation was given.This was day six and I was more than furious so I called to talk to someone hoping they weren't completely incompetent like the driver and last few employers I had talked to that lied to me. Wrong. He was as incompetent as they were. He told me there was nothing he could do and he couldn't refund the rest of the money which was thirty dollars and change and that it was the driver's fault, not there's. NO! The driver is contracted from Walmart, not me, and going by what he said, they just stole thirty dollars from me, and there was nothing that could be done. I told him I wanted my money back or products in not so nice words. I requested to talk to a supervisor, and that's when he said he would refund other items equal to the amount not refunded. Then I get the refund, and it's like sixteen dollars, and the app still says pending. This isn't the first time this has happened, and our order has been missing items paid for several times. They always crush our bread, too. What they have as a service for convenience is exactly the opposite, not worth it, and a clown show. If you can avoid delivery service, do it.

It truly is a much need service.Date of experience: December 22, 2022",4,Grocery

Warin,SE,"Updated Sep 13, 2023","Once Upon A Time In AmericaI'm 68 years old. Once upon a time in America, businesses used to compete regarding who gave the best service.  In the 1960s someone came up with the idea of scrapping service attendants and making customers pump their own gas.  That turned out to yield more profit. Walmart has taken this concept to the extreme.  Not only have they done away with at first the baggers and then the checkers. They've outsourced deliveries AND customer service agents.  Walmart is a billion dollar company. They could afford to give MUCH better service.  But that would reduce profits. IMHO, they're greedy to the max.  Nevertheless, THAT'S why their service sucks.  LOWER SERVICE = HIGHER PROFITS.TIP: Use PayPal.  Never give Walmart your credit card information.  If you need a refund and Walmart tries to rip you off, you can complain to PayPal and they will retrieve your money. If you have already given Walmart your credit card data, go to the website and delete your card from their files.Date of experience: August 28, 2023",1,Grocery

They just don't care.I've had some issues with delays the last few times I've ordered from Walmart +, but I thought I'd give them another chance because of the money you save. I placed an order yesterday morning for maybe 20 grocery items. I had chosen a time in the late afternoon. Right at the beginning of the delivery window, I get notified that the order was delayed 2 hours. It would now arrive when I wasn't around. So, I reschedule it for tomorrow morning 8-9 am. Well, here we are today and at 8 am I see that the order is still ""pending"" but with no time in sight. I contact the Walmart + customer service who tells me the new time is 2-3 pm. I'm sorry, this is absolutely unacceptable. People depend on their grocery deliveries to feed their families. They clearly don't care about people or doing right by them. I cancelled my Walmart+ membership immediately and will no longer be getting anything from Walmart.Date of experience: January 08, 2023",1,Grocery

Brockleesodamane,US,"Nov 13, 2022","I have been using Walmart grocery…I have been using Walmart grocery delivery for about 3 years or so. I have only had a couple issues here and there that were due to the delivery driver. Lately, orders aren’t arriving at all due to “lack of drivers” but have had drivers available to deliver some of the add ons. Anyway, my main issue is their insane increase in pricing. I mean it’s really gotten out of control. I have had to be extra cautious of what substitutions I have as well. They will upcharge tf out of you with the substitutions. It used to be that they wouldn’t up-charge you for not having the product you ordered, they would match the price or find something lower or at the same price. Example: I bought the big container of blue Gatorade for 3.98 and they substituted it with I think 2-12 packs for about $8. Their great value prices have gone up so much that they are only .50 cents to $1.00 less than the organic non-gmo brand expensive brands. With 2 autistic toddlers going to the store to shop is really not fun but I’d rather do that than be F-d by Walmart.Date of experience: October 27, 2022",2,Grocery

Ended when I went outside to see what all the yelling was about. I live in a quiet middle class neighborhood.) as well as delayed packages and when I tried to cancel since I needed it ASAP, they wouldn't let me cancel and wouldn't give me a new ETA. I just find that Walmart doesn't care at all about their customers. Compared to Amazon Prime where I always get a successful resolution to problems/issues. I have experienced all this within my 30 day trial. I would love to subscribe, but the issues are just too great. So sad. I am old enough to remember when Walmart first started and their focus was on customers and a great experience. Now they have gone the way of Kmart.

There is a large note at the front door saying DO NOT leave groceries here. Leave at back door. But they leave my groceries at the front door 99 % of time. Which causes a lot of problems as I can barely get around.  When this happens I remove the tip.  Now I have trouble even getting them to deliver period.  I call Walmart and complain but nothing changes.  In fact now they leave groceries with item spilled out etc. I think they must think I am putting tips on then removing after I get my stuff!!!  Not true. But I won’t tip when I have to go get them. Walmart says u can cancel your delivery subscription but if u do u do not get a penny back.

I was getting delivery however stopped after the driver stole items off my porch (had video and walmart never called me back after initial complaint). So started doing pick up. Items are ALWAYS out of stock. Substitutions are literally funny. Ordered peanut butter one time and got toothbrushes. Ordered a king blanket and they gave me a twin, I denied the substitution and they still charged me for it. Today was kind of the last straw, ordered cat food. They didn’t have the size and substituted with a different size but same brand and type. Get home and the cat food isn’t there. Call the store to come back and pick it up and of course no one picks up. Call customer service who says they’re busy serving others their orders which is likely why they aren’t answering (but they failed to get me all my items) so only option was refund which takes like 5-7 business days. And like a lot of people I’m on a limited budget, so waiting a week for my cat food money back is a hard kick. Customer service gave zero craps.

Walmart REFUSED to refund my money. It's response was: We delivered the items. Duh! The company should be investigated by the Board of Health as much of the food I received had to be thrown away.. And, I was a Walmart Plus Member  and asked to have the balance of my membership fee ($100) refunded and the request was refused even though my membership just began at the end of May 2023. FYI -- if you complain or return items, Walmart will cancel your account. This is how the company deals with its own issues -- using Doordash to deliver the food you ordered and using off shore customer service reps who cannot speak or understand English, making it impossible for customers to get refunds.

I looked at the mobile app and saw that they said I had picked up my groceries a half hour earlier.  I called .com and said I had not been given my groceries and they can check their cameras to see I was telling the truth and no one had ever approached my car.

At 11pm while still waiting outside she gets a note from the driver saying he just dropped her order off at her house.

Nancy,US,"Updated May 10, 2024","Terrible experience todayTerrible experience today.  The order was delivered to the wrong apartment by Megan from the Baldwin Park, Ca store.  First, I called to talk to a rep, but they would only let me talk to their stupid, idiot ""artificial intelligence,"" which said to wait 48 hours--the food would spoil by then!  At least humans have common sense, unlike AI.  I tried more than once and will try again to get a refund on missing items and cancel my membership.We decided to look for the items.  It's a large complex, so we spent a lot of time walking around looking for it (this is the second time this has happened).  This was very stressful, especially with health issues.  I finally found it, with the tenant who lives there going through the items just outside her door.  I knew from past experience that she has some psychological or mental problems.  So, I asked if she had taken anything inside.  She said, ""No, it's all here.""  That was a lie.  There were many items missing that she had clearly taken.  We knocked on her door and waited, no answer.  However, she was looking out the window at us, obviously guilty of stealing.THIS IS THE LAST TIME THAT I EVER USE WALMART DELIVERY.  ALL BECAUSE THE DRIVER DELIVERED IT TO THE WRONG APARTMENT! USE ANOTHER SERVICE, NOT WALMART!!Update:Walmart refunded us for the order.  However, it wasn't worth the time, effort and insult of having a neighbor steal groceries.  There was a lot of time spent on figuring out amounts charged because the $ amounts of items ordered don't match up with the bank's list of charges (it's weird, I know).  There are many charges to go through.Date of experience: May 04, 2024",1,Grocery

Mindware Consulting,US,"Feb 19, 2023","⚠️ On average, you WILL NOT receive 8 out of 10 items you order!! Read below!⚠️ Our company used ""Walmart delivery from store"" 25 times over a 2 week period, utilizing 3 different store locations and delivering to 5 different residences.  This resulted in only 2 out of 10 items ultimately being delivered at all. On every single order,  The driver stated the item was no longer available, and Walmart chose to leave the items off the order and not replace them with similar available items, as we requested when ordering.  When ordering wash cloths, sheetsets, towels, air mattresses, and many other common household items, they simply said item not available and didn't send anything. I don't need to tell you that Walmart is full of washcloths, towels, and bed sheets... They could have easily provided an alternate option rather than simply scratching it off the list and giving us nothing. If you depend on the delivery of your items, do not use this service. As a result, we lost clients and had chargebacks in excess of $9,000 from disgruntled airbnb clients who required the items when promised and ultimately walked out on the reservation when items promised did not arrive.  Even when items were in stock, drivers often just don't show up and leave the order in limbo for days beyond before automatically canceling the order.  There is no way to communicate with the driver and when you speak with Walmart support, they speak from a script and make false promises that do not get fulfilled. There is a reason everyone opts for Amazon....  But for same day delivery this was our only perceived option, which backfired in a massive way.Date of experience: February 17, 2023",1,Grocery

Elizabeth Nudd Edens,US,"Mar 17, 2023","I have recently experienced what I can…I have recently experienced what I can only call a serious bait and switch operation when ordering groceries via store delivery or InHome from Walmart.It revolves around one product that I have been ordering regularly for 3 years.The Fancy Feast Filet Mignon dry cat food comes in 2 sized at Walmart. A 3 lb bag for $9.00 and a 7 lb bag for $16.98. When I ordered a 7 lb bag, I received a text saying it would be shipped rather than via delivery. That was no problem, litter is often switched as well. However, the delivery was a 3lb bag at a cost of $22.00 instead of the 7lb bag ordered, for $16.98.When I went back and reviewed my actual order, sure enough, it showed up as 7lb on the order, but 3lb in the cart! I had to ship it back with a printed label, but did get a refund.Yesterday I ordered another 7lb bag via InHome and that is what showed up in the cart. But an hour later, when adding to my order, sure enough, the cart then showed the 3lb size at the higher price! I cancelled the order. To see if this was merely a glitch, I ordered again today, this time 2 - 7lb bags and within an hour, the email confirmation for the placed order switched the 2 - 7lb bags to 2 - 3lb bags, but at the price of 2 - 7lb bags to be delivered. 3 times is not a glitch, it is an intentional switch-and-bait. This means that if I continue to order from Walmart, I will have no choice but to recheck the order an hour or so after receiving confirmation and go through it item by item checking prices and weight.Needless to say, I will simply stop purchasing from Walmart . I have no idea how many other items I have paid a higher price for, than I originally ordered. This is a very grave concern and I have tried to reach the store, to no avail. They simply don't answer the phone. I will try the corporation next.Best advice? DO NOT TRUST WALMART ONLINE GROCERY ORDERING.

Bane,US,"Jan 21, 2023","I am surprised that Walmart has a 1.4…I am surprised that Walmart has a 1.4 rating. It’s completely unreliable; their instructions always both confusing and contradictory, I drove 15 miles in a blizzard because I received notification that Walmart had  made a delivery early.  There are no tire tracks on my street, nor were there humans tracks. There was no delivery   It’s very confusing about what they were supposed to deliver and what was canceled and apparently nothing was delivered. I received notification that my orders were being shipped early    Then I received notification that my items were on the way!  None of the dates they gave me were correct  and then I received notification that my items had been delivered .  What are the items that are early ?  What are the items delayed ?  What items were on their way ? I told them that nothing was delivered that day, and then the reply was. ... what items weren't delivered?The problem with this is eyed orders of a few hundred dollars worth of things. There were a bunch of items and I had no idea what your schedule was and apparently they didn't either. So I repeated to them again they were items on a specific day. On the surface this service seems very exciting ... we are told that Walmart will deliver everything for free but they’ll charge me at least a  7 to $10 tip without permission. It's not free and this is misleading   I was charged seven dollars for a tip  ….I didn’t receive anything.  The items were delivered altogether and I was charged a $7 tip for each delivery.    if Walmart delivery worked the way it’s supposed to work it would be wonderful; but as it is, it’s totally unreliable  The delivery and instructions are often a violation of common sense and rationality   I  have a security fence area. They could’ve tossed  the light items inside where people couldn’t reach it;  but they leave it right by the sidewalk where people can steal it. It makes absolutely no sense.  Sometimes they make the delivery and sometimes they don't. You have to look and you don't know if you find anything.   Not all the deliveries are bad I do have some where they will put the object in a place they won't easily be stolen.... but they also plays at where someone can just reach down from the sidewalk and grab it Of course, there are a lot of alternatives to Walmart and I can see why some people don't like Walmart.  Walmart has really great prices, but when your charge some thing and you don't receive it, it's not a great price  In many cases, really bad labor.  In times like these it’s understandable but the notices Walmart sends are always contradictory and I don’t know what I’m supposed to get.  It’s just pure chaos and this worry creates stress ... it's very disturbing I was also told several hours after the items were supposedly delivered that they were delivered but then it turned out that they weren’t delivered.  I found myself walking around in the cold in the dark looking for packages that weren't there. I would not use the service if I were you. I hope people start going to the alternative stores who offer a better service and maybe Walmart will improve.Date of experience: January 18, 2023",1,Grocery
Teresa. Wells,US,"Jul 30, 2023","Does Walmart make more $$ not delivering what they promise?I tried the grocery delivery again after having a successful experience or 2 - a rarity, I promise. First off, it you don't tip 15%, you likely won't even receive your order. They will tell you it's delayed...and delayed...and that your only recourse is to cancel it and get a refund. But if you use a debit or credit card (how else can you order from them online?), you will WAIT for your $$ for up to 10 days! If you are a senior on a fixed income like me and you have no extra money lying around, you will just have to go hungry. This happens more times than not, but again, if like me, you paid the annual fee for free delivery and can't afford to use a different store, you have no choice because they stopped giving refunds for Walmart+ no matter how many times they don't do what you paid for. Tonight, I expected an order between 6 and 7 pm that I asked to sign for, but a knock on the door never came. I open the door to see about 18 bags of groceries there that did not belong to me. I ask to sign because this has happened before - more than once. I start online, go through the prompts to have someone call me. Of course they cannot help me, they can't call the driver because they don't have the number, but I can keep the wrong  groceries,  cancel, and get a refund -  of cours, in 10 DAYS!!!  I explain I have a broken foot, am 67, and am quite ill, that it was going to be difficult to bring in all that food in my condition, that I have no money to reorder until I get my refund, and that this happens all the time and that I'm so frustrated I'm now ready to cry. She says call the store, maybe they can find the driver. I call the store and surprise! they don't have a way to reach him either and I will have to call the 800 number which I explain I already talked to. She says she can't help. I call the 800 number back. That person says there is nothing she can do about any of it. I make her reach out to someone higher up who says there is no mechanism for them to do anything. So, I dragged in and back out (with my broken foot and oxygen) a whole bunch of food  I'm sure someone really needed. Lots of chicken  and more that would've spoiled and that I had no room for in an apartment size refrigerator. Neighbors came to take what they could. I get a text from Walmart saying ""Good news! We initiated your refund"" which takes a week and a half. The audacity and insensitivity of that text makes me really sad and really angry. Walmart does not even seem to be trying to correct all the issues with grocery delivery and I'm left wondering if they make more money with the annual fees they won't refund and with all the cancelled orders they have use of the funds to earn money on. I used to be in banking and can well guess how much they make in just a 24 hour period with our money. It's unconscionable how Walmart  mistreats their customers, especially those with limited resources. Shame on them! And shame on me for trusting the Walmart name and not checking out review sites other than theirs before paying that annual fee. This has been going on for months and months and months and it doesn't matter much where you are in parts of N FL or which store you order from. I write positive reviews for almost everyone with whom I do business so it distresses me to write what I have about Walmart +, but people must be warned if they depend on them to bring them something as essential as their groceries :(Date of experience: July 28, 2023",1,Grocery

They refuse to answer the phone in the store. Customer service in India always tells you what you already know & assures you they will refund your money. Well gee, thanks, but when can I get my freaking order? Who knows. I will never renew Walmart +. It’s a huge ripoff. Amazon is great.

Privacy Concern ,US,"Oct 7, 2022","Wal-Mart online grocery outlet WORST!My review of Wal-Mart online grocery outlet WORST!Let’s start - I was ordering a few things online and to get to Wal-Mart’s $35 for free shipping I added what I thought was a 12 pack of Kool-Aid as it was priced just over $4 with tax. When it arrived, it was a single packet you know the same one they sell for .30 cents in the store. I called Walmart and told them I would not except this as even in their email reply called it a multi pack. The agent I talked to was very nice and agreed this must have been a mistake and said she would refund my money, no problem right! Well, I get the email and they try to tell me this is what I ordered, and I needed to return it, no problem right! Well, there’s no return label or instructions so I blacked out my delivery address and wrote RETURN TO SENDER took 2 pictures of the procedure and replied to the email, no problem right! Here is their reply:Sales Order Id:  200010240798324Item:   Kool-Aid Unsweetened Black Cherry Artificially Flavored Powdered Soft Drink Mix, 0.13 oz Packet, Multipack Quantity: 1   (I high-lighted for you to see)We are not going to apologize for something we made no money on. Shipping costs $3.30 - Walmart fees were .50 and the kool aid costs us .40. Apparently you thing it is free to ship items. The cheapest shipping with a tracking number which is required is 3.30.________________________________________Walmart Customer Service Team Reminder where we started - I was trying to get to $35 for FREE SHIPPING! So yeh I think my shipping should be FREE! My total order: Includes all fees, taxes and discounts$40.92They could have apologized admitted the mistake sent a 12 pack to my local store on their next truck, hell I would have opened the pack and handed one back to keep it fair. But no, I get this, I don’t care about the $4 I’m probably out it’s really about BIG business sticking it to us day after day and they just don’t care.Date of experience: October 05, 2022",1,Grocery

The ""Local Store""  will not take care of the problem for the customer, but pushed customer Into the unpredictable new line “Customer Service Department” where lies or misinformation is poured out by non-USA personnel. 4. The refund ( only part of the problem) was purposely given for a ""lessor amount""... error by accident. Place an online order as I have done a number of times over the last couple of years.  Delivery instructions requested that the order (as always) should be dropped off in front of my garage and only after they had texted just prior to dropping it off. The order was delivered to my old address, even though my account clearly shows only my new address.  No text was sent prior to delivery to the “wrong address”.  It was dropped off outside the service window we were required to fill out.They blocked the driveway of my old house with the order…   so the new owners of the house called me and asked what “I” Was going to do about it.The local store was called and they said they could do “nothing” … that I would have to call Customer Service.  They indicated that they will not not call their  own “Walmart Customer Service” , but I must call another number and wait for someone to pick up and speak with them ourselves.I called your “Customer Service dept” and Customer Service stated they could do nothing about the order they dropped off and… that the most they could do was give me a refund.  They lied about not having the resources to have the items picked up, they said it was Walmart's Policy to just leave it there… even if it is blocking someones driveway.Customer Service is farmed out to another country, and even from another country… they lies and said they do not have the resources in my area t pick up a mis-delivered order.  Or, even move it.Their ( Customer Service outside the USA) gives misinformation to the customer, and the customer likely either is believed by the naive or accepted out of complete exasperation.A list of errors:1. Deliver to the wrong address2.Local store cannot take care of problem3.Local store will not take care of the problem for the customer, but pushed customer Into the unpredictable “Customer Service Department” where lies or misinformationmanned by personnel from another country are given scripts for various issues with very littleauthority to actually take care of the problem properly.4. Refund purposely given for a lessor amount to cheat the customerThe beginning of the problem is that when a customer visits and logs in, the address is loaded into memory so that it can be used for delivery and identification when needed.  However, when an address Is changed during the same sign-in---  the programmer forgot to clear the memory location of the old address info and replace with the current info.  That is how the account shows the new address , but the info sent to the delivery personnel show only old info.  ( The order was placed after the sign -n and new address edit ).The balance of the errors are Walmart Policies and/or the perceived understanding of them..  along with…. an overworked and under trained management…which management has  little or no business foresight.The policies of Walmart and the software of Walmart used to be “state of the art” … now Walmart is regressing and will never catch up to companies like Amazon… in software or insightful business policies/plan.

Melissa,US,"Aug 23, 2022","Run Away!!!In northern VA - Run - Run - Run Away!  Cancelled my W+ membership last night (8/22/22). Signed up for membership several months ago and at first there was no issues with my grocery delivery orders then in May 2022 my grocery order was mysteriously delayed with no explanation or ETA when it might be delivered.  Tried calling the Wal-Mart store that was fulfilling order but no one will answer the phone - EVER!  I had to cancel order. I tried to place the order again 2 days later and this time it was delivered.In mid May became very ill and couldn't leave my house (no, it wasn't Covid) but for the rest of May, June and July of 2022 my grocery delivery orders arrived without issue.  Starting in Aug, Aug 7th to be exact , my grocery order was delayed again but no explanation as to why or when it might be delivered so had to cancel the order.  I tried to get that same order re-delivered on Aug 11 and again, during the time it was to be delivered I get another delay message and you guessed it, no indication as to what happened or when the order might be delivered so had to cancel that order.  Finally, yesterday, on August 22, I called to speak to some at the Help Center and this person said he would give me a Promo of $15 and to give it another try.  So I decided that 'just one more time' I'll try and place an order for the 3rd time so I placed the order around noon on Sun (to be delivered between 6 & 7 PM) and when I check the order status it shows it's still being prepared.  By 6:40 PM I receive a notification of order delayed and no explanation or new ETA when or if order would arrive.  I call the Help Center and tell this person that 3 times in a row this month my grocery orders are getting delayed with no explanation or any new delivery time.  The Help person looks into the order and sees that the Delivery driver cancelled the delivery.  How is that even allowed???  I told the Help person I had tried to call that store a couple times but no one will ever answer the phone.  I told the Help person at this point to cancel my membership and that I also wanted a refund of my Aug membership fee of $12.95 so he said he'd do both plus escalate the issue to this particular store.So my guess is that these drivers shop around to see where they can get the biggest tip on a delivery and arbitrarily cancel any other grocery delivery order they don't want to take but I told the Help person that these drivers should never even have the option to cancel a delivery order.  Also, I told the Help person that for my yearly Amazon membership includes delivery with no tip needed and I've always received my Amazon deliveries without ever an issue so no more wasting my time with WalMart.

I am also diabetic and low income so it was helpful to have same day delivery of affordable healthy foods. Also we’re on a budget and fixed income. So at first this made sense, as we were saving a TON of money compared to the places in walking distance that sold groceries. Then over the last 6 wks or so things have been very weird. First we started having issues with billing. The pre Auth would drop off days later and not be finalized. Then a final total would come out a week later. Which can be confusing if u don’t notice it. Then I started having things double charged and random smaller charges that I had not authorized coming out. I have had to file THREE(3),yes..THREE(3) disputes for charges in the last two weeks with my bank as walmart would not refund. Most recently, the straw that broke the back, was an order completed at 2 pm and paid for. It was pulled, completed and waiting to be delivered. However it was never delivered. I spoke w someone at the location that said they couldn’t do anything with it u til the online order was reinitiated. However no one could take the order off of hold ether at the store or at the customer service center. I finally spoke w someone forthcoming at the cs center he told me that they have control at the store level once the order has been submitted. He also told me there has been a slew of recent complaints that are similar in regards to billing and non delivery. I have now cancelled my monthly subscription to W+.

I waited 1 hour and still no groceries. I talked to someone at corporate customer service and got a refund. I had to go in the store to get 2 items I really needed. I almost collapsed becasue I should not have been walking in the store on that day. That's what I thought grocery pickup was for! This store at Montfort/Dallas has a long history of problems and no one was answering any phones at any extension on that day. 10 minutes after I arrived in the parking spot I received a text message that order had been picked up. I've seen that before, every time I have used grocery pickup. It's a lie. Never received any groceries at all in 1 hour of waiting. I will say that the corporate customer service rep was helpful and processed a refund. What about delivery?  Walmart's delivery is a joke - been there , done that. Walmart delivery is the worst of the worst. The only positive department at Monfort store is the pharmacy - always efficient and courteus.

Mikki Barrett,US,"Jul 17, 2022","WALMART IMPLEMENT CHANGES PLEASEI have been ordering groceries online from Walmart intermittently for about 4 years now. My orders have been intermittent because of the service. I try the Walmart+ program then become dissatisfied, stop it and then try it again later in hopes that improvements have been made. There are many positives to online ordering from Walmart: Prices are the same as in store, I can order anytime 24/7, product selection is fairly good and most importantly to me, I save a great deal of time. Recently, the cons are outweighing the pros though: Items are being substituted when I requested they be excluded from substitution, i.e., I requested Star ham salad and received chicken salad instead (chicken and ham salad are not even similar), quite a few products are not available but are listed on the site, and delivery is often shoddy because they use other delivery services. I have had deliveries that have never arrived and conversations with drivers who have been incredibly rude.  Today, I had to request a refund for an inappropriate substitution and was informed that now Walmart is offering InHome delivery provided by their employees who will put your food away in your kitchen.   In theory this is great but they also are charging an additional $7 a month to do this bringing the cost to $138 a year for the service AND you still have to make a purchase of $35 for them to deliver free. As a single woman who is not cooking for a family, I prefer fresh produce and other foods that are not shelf stable which requires I shop more frequently, sometimes 4-5 days a week.  Requiring that I spend $35 to have these products delivered free every time is cost prohibitive. I generally spend in the neighborhood of $15-$20 for the ""quick shops"" and buy shelf stable items a couple of times a month so basically I'm ordering from Walmart 2 times a month and personally shopping about 12 times a month at a local market close by.  That's an additional   $75-$100 weekly that could be used at Walmart if they did't have a $35 minimum purchase! I applaud Walmart for starting their InHome service but they need to drop the minimum purchase requirement before I would consider paying them an additional $7 a month.Date of experience: July 17, 2022",2,Grocery

Erica Storey,US,"Jun 24, 2022","over 15 items missing on my pick up order that took me 3hrs to get it made rightI waited over 25 minutes for them to bring my stuff out. Pick up was 5-6 and I didn’t get out of there until after 5:30. I actually had to call the number and ask if there was something wrong bc it was taking so long. Once I got home (25min away) which was after 6pm.  I unload and start putting things away and notice about 15 items are missing…not just small things either. Like a large pack of raw chicken wings,  package of family size raw cubed beef, the big bag of grated fiesta blend cheese, 8 corn on cob, 2 cauliflower heads, 3 pk of romaine hearts and more…to me this isn’t a mistake bc there is NO way someone could just overlook and miss that many items….very disappointed. I was also charged for the only unavailable item .I called Walmart and it took me over 15 min to get someone to pick up then another 40 min for the gentleman helping me on the phone to get my order to come up on computer and go through all the items missing. I couldnt just let it go bc that is a lot of money out of my pocket if not made right. Now it’s past 7pm once Im off phone and my young children haven’t even ate dinner yet bc and it’s already PAST their bed time. Dinner menu had to change bc my cubed beef is still at the store. I understand things happen but over 15 items missing is a bit much. I still have to go back today to pick up my missing items and I pray it’s NOT eventful. location : Moore , OK supercenterSadly, Walmart makes so much money they dont need us bc it looks like there are a significant amount of 1 star reviews and nothing changes and they dont offer any apologies or any compensation for the mess they created.

Ok fine but then you tip the driver. Ok another $15.  They want you to tip 29 percent.  But not on $250-$275 groceries and the fee and tip.I use to order once a month.  But for the last 3 I go to checkout and every time 45-47 items out of stock!What???  We have the largest Super center in CO.  And a regular walmart with groceries on other side of town.  See also have King Soopers Safeways Whole foods Beavers and a few others like Target.  In a town of 110,000.So why does everything say out of stock?Why because website is not working right.I always get the 45-47 items out of stock.Well their solution is use a different browser.  Delete and reinstall app clear cookies place order on phone.  Really?  I don’t use app it doesn’t work right. I use 3 different devices.Laptop PC or i phone.  Safari Firefox Google or duckduckgo or yahoo.  I clear cookies daily. And how am I going to place an order on the phone for 45 + items?  Usually they are outside USA and hard to understand.I would be livid if I paid for membership to Walmart.  Oh forgot we have Cosco and Sams club too.  And Loveland CO has a super center and Cheyenne has one.  So it’s not like they aren’t getting shipments.I am immune compromised so I can’t just run out and get groceries.  I have CFS and the heat and shopping then loading and unloading about kills me.  I also am severely allergic to certain scents.  Everytime I go shopping I end up having an attack in line.Sweating and breathing issues.Antiphalaxis.  I have asmtha too.And allergic to all antibiotics.So very dangerous for me to shop.What is going on Walmart?Oh and watch out for the 3rd parties on Walmart.  Very few are honest or fast shipping.

Mrs J McG,US,"Updated May 25, 2022","Beware. Don’t trust Walmart online grocery delivery order 5-22-22On 5-22-22 I placed an online grocery order and selected a delivery time between 12-1pm. The order was for 8 items which included a $7.95 fee for delivery. The groceries were purchased for an elderly relative who is a shut in and who recently had surgery. This time frame came and went without a delivery. I did receive an alert on my Walmart app that it was delayed. I made several calls to the Neptune,NJ store, but no one ever answered the phone that day, I tried calling the store again on Monday, 5-23-22 and the associate who answered the phone never even asked me for my name or order #, then rudely snapped at me and said “I told you to call the number I gave you!” I politely told her that I had not yet spoke to anyone, then she replied “Well you sound just like another woman who just called”. I then called the new # she gave me and the associate told me the order was “ready” and should be delivered by noon that day (Monday). We’ll that time frame came and went without any grocery delivery. I then called went online at Walmart Customer Care Center. I gave them my info again and explained my situation to them. They put me on hold and tried to call the store themselves. She apologized to me because she was also not able to get through to the store either, so she gave me a $5 promo on a future order and told me to please be patient. I waited all day Monday and again no groceries. So then I called the 1-800 # for help. Again, the Customer Care helper could not get through to the store. They filed a formal complaint and asked me several times to cancel the order. I told them no, please do not cancel the order that these groceries were important for an elderly women without food. They told me they would assign a 3rd party driver because it was listed as “lost in transit”. Day 3 - Tuesday 5-24-22 still no groceries so I called back again. So frustrating. This time the women who answered the call at the local Neptune, NJ store said she had no computer so she could not look it up and had to take my order # and name and she would get back to me. Apparently she took it upon herself to just cancel my grocery order. Her solution to a problem delivery was to cancel my order after I specifically told this woman and everyone I spoke to at Walmart for the past 3 days that I needed the groceries for an elderly shut in and I did not want to cancel, but apparently this was how they got rid of their delivery driver problem! Walmart canceled my order without my consent, If Walmart can’t do the job, they should not offer the delivery service! I am very disappointed by this experience.

Kittycat,US,"Apr 28, 2022","I had been an online grocery delivery…I had been an online grocery delivery order customer for almost 2 years this year and there were many times when I had ordered a large order and some items I payed for were missing, one time they delivered 2 big boxes of cereal boxes I didn't even order while other items were missing! I complained to Walmart.com customer service many times and I was always given a refund, I even asked them to pass my complaint to their corporate office and had the reference number emailed to me. Now things got much worse, two weeks ago I had scheduled for a delivery of a large grocery order for 6-7pm,and my instructions were always on the site for them to call me 5 minutes before they arrive so I can go down and put a bag between the outside building because the intercoms are always broken, I don't want any contact because of Covid-19,so I then need them to come up and bring my items inside and place them on my tables and or couch because I have a very bad painful back condition and I really can't life heavy bags and bend over and I'm on the third last floor of my apartment complex and  I always give them a 20$ tip for large orders like these and in the past I was really lucky to have very kind good delivery people from Walmart who did bring all of my large amount of groceries and even place them inside on my tables and couch.  After the second recent time that they never called and didn't deliver my order, a young woman from Walmart called me  2 days later after I had complained to customer service, and she asked me if I still wanted them to deliver my order and told me they are short staffed at this store, I told her that I had already canceled the order. Well they never called me and I waited and waited and they never delivered my order, so I re-scheduled for 2 days later and they did the same thing again! It only said on their web site that my order was delayed, after they did this the second time I called up customer service and said to cancel my order and give me a refund which they did. Two days before, the first time this happened a guy only delivered the cereal box I ordered and a few non perishable items were shipped for both orders. Last night was the last straw, I gave them one last chance and placed a very large grocery order and a few non grocery items to be delivered between 6-7 pm, they never called me again and didn't deliver my order and around 11 am the next day my next door neighbor rang my bell and told me that a lot of grocery bags were left outside and there were a lot of items that needed to be frozen and refrigerated so they were ruined, I don't even know how long they were left outside and it was 70 degrees this day! My neighbor was very nice enough to bring the non perishable items up to me and throw out all of the perishable items.  I called customer service and the agent gave me a refund but she also said that's really weird because on her end it doesn't even say it was delivered it says it was being prepared and had been delayed, and on my end the site and an email from them the day before said just delayed, no other information was provided.A couple of months before these incidents a very nice helpful delivery guy told me when I told him that some items I ordered were missing again, that it's Walmart you can't expect that much, and he said they have poor customer service, and he also told me that he was left waiting in their parking lot once for two hours before he was able to get the customer's groceries and deliver them!  I looked up reviews for this store location and sure enough a guy Stu had the same thing happen to him, they never called him or delivered his online order three times and he said he didn't even get a phone call or follow up email and he said avoid it at all costs unless you feel like wasting hours on the phone getting transferred multiple times to get a refund and he put 3 !!!

Waited a week for a notice for Fed ex to pick up the bike, when I called on Friday the representative just said that there was a note but never placed the Fed ex order.

Anthony Mark,US,"Jan 3, 2025","Poor Customer Service and Unprofessional Attitude – Avoid This LocationWe’ve been loyal 7-Eleven customers for over 20 years, but my experience at this location (7285 Crestway Dr, San Antonio, TX 78239) was beyond disappointing. Unfortunately, this wasn’t the first time my family or I encountered rude & unprofessional behavior from the staff here, but this incident was unacceptable! On Wednesday, January 2, 2025, I visited the store around 5 PM to pay for a car wash. When I inquired about the car wash, one clerk (Ricky) rudely stated it wasn’t working without any greeting or explanation, while another clerk (BZ - I guess) contradicted him and said it was functional. Both clerks didn’t know what’s happening in their location, displayed nasty and unfriendly facial expressions throughout the interaction, making it clear they were not welcoming or approachable to customers. Trusting BZ’s word, I paid and proceeded to use the car wash. Unfortunately, the car wash malfunctioned. The soap application did not work, and the system merely rinsed and dried my car without actually cleaning it. I returned to the store to inform the clerks, and Ricky admitted he had warned it wasn’t working. However, BZ dismissed my concerns, claiming my car parked outside looked clean because it was wet. Their rude attitudes and lack of basic customer service skills were extremely frustrating! After much back-and-forth and even waiting for BZ to test the car wash himself, he eventually admitted the soap function wasn’t working properly. However, instead of issuing a full refund as they promised at the beginning, they refunded only $5, insisting that since I had already used the car wash, I wasn’t getting more than that. Their unpleasant demeanor and refusal to resolve the issue professionally were infuriating. When I requested to speak with a manager, they laughed at me, ignored my concerns, and told me to come back the next day and that there’s no manager there. Their behavior was not only unprofessional but also disrespectful. Another customer in line even sympathized with me, acknowledging how poor their service was. In the end, my car remained dirty, I wasted my time and money, and I left feeling insulted. This location’s staff clearly lack the basic training and customer service skills needed for such roles. 7-Eleven management needs to take immediate action to train employees and ensure consistent service across all locations. I will not return to this store, and I plan to share this bad experience on Google Reviews, Yelp, and other online platforms to ensure others are aware of the unprofessional treatment customers might face here. Additionally, I will bring this up at our upcoming HOA meeting to inform all neighbors about this poor service to avoid this place.Until changes are made, I recommend avoiding this location entirely.Date of experience: January 02, 2025",1,Grocery

Michael,US,"Nov 15, 2021","Customer service is a JOKEI think this might possibly win the award for absolutely worst customer service ever. The only reason I’m giving it 2 stars is this is literally the only way you can order tobacco for delivery in New Jersey so respect for that. Most of the time my orders (which are small) take 2+ hours to be delivered. Everytime I contact customer service the same way I would with DoorDash and Postmates. The customer service reps (yes all of them) could care freaking less about your problem. You know if you have the slightest issue with your order on Door Dash and they immediately without question will refund that item but usually the entire order? After the 4-5 time with this new 7/11 app I asked the rep, after waiting 2 hours for my stuff, if I could get a refund on this items. They said no, not unless you cancel the order. It’s dumbfounding every single time I contact CS which is more then half the time and they do LITERALLY ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

First, mislabeled products on the shelves and not honoring the price is a problem on you and not the customer. The audacity of one cashier try to argue the point when it was clear they put the price on the shelf. would an employee try to get mad at a customer for pointing this out?Next, the gas pumps rarely have receipt paper and it's unfortunate that someone elderly or disabled have to go into the store to retrieve a receipt because they are to lazy to do their job. When you go into the store to get the receipt, they act as if you're the problem. This is a customer based business. If you have a problem with doing your job (servicing a customer), then this job is not for you.Date of experience: April 25, 2023",1,Grocery

This employee is known for scamming customer's. One example that I can give you is that he will charge me extra money for the items that I will buy. I know he does this on purpose because I went to this other 7-Eleven store not that far from that one. So I noticed that I got some change back from what I purchased. I asked the cashier how much he charges for cigarettes and he said $9 and some change. And at this store that I'm talking about he charges me $11 flat. That's because he adds $1 extra to the register. So I explained about me getting some change back from the other store when I would buy the same pack of cigarettes every time. He would respond with a grin on his face saying we'll go to the other store then. This is not fair for customers to be buying from this employee not knowing how much he charged extra.

(Until recently I had no problem signing on.) I found a way to get a verification code by email; however, it does not work. After putting in my phone number and clicking, there was a request to resend the code. After clicking this, I was able to get the verification code by email. However, the code does not work. I called and talked to someone in customer support plus another in management and they could not explain anything except to state that a mobile phone was needed to get a text. So the situation suggests that 7-11 is out of touch and does not care about resolving the matter plus that there are major system problems as a verification code is sent by email but does not work. I do not think another phone number would work so using someone else's phone might not be a suitable choice. Why should I even have to borrow or buy a phone. I am at an impasse.

Woodrow,US,"Jul 30, 2021","7-Eleven should be ashamedHere in the region of Texas where I live 7-Eleven bought a number of stores that were mostly local owned but a few from other larger companies as well, this started a couple of years ago.  The ones here locally I am more familiar with seem to experience a high turnover in employees.  Most are friendly enough but nearly all pretty much have the ""I'm not here long"" attitude but are still friendly.  The stores themselves are no longer kept up the way they were when locally owned.  Beverage coolers are now kept at the sort-of-cool setting.  Familiar items that once were there are gone to be replaced by 7-Eleven packaged items, which are at a level of not that good all to themselves.  The store closest to me has had the air conditioning out since late June and they have been relying on some portable units that struggle to keep the inside somewhat cooler than the outside and do nothing about the humidity, you would think corporate could at least have an air conditioner repaired in a south Texas store, especially in the summer.

Most of the employees are professional and courteous to custermers except except a mature lady, Sophia. She's very inconsiderate and has no awareness of custermer/business relations. This lady acts as if the customers need to bow down to her for service. For instance, I walked into the store to pay for to pay for gas and as a courtesy or some decency, I said good morning and Sophia act as if didn't existed. Another employee nervously worked over to ring up my gas and other merchant. To my disbelief, Sophia shuts dow the pump while while I was in the process of pumping over $25 of $35 of my gas. Ultimately, it took me an additional 15+ minutes for an overall 28 minutes for a refund or continue to get gas. Of course I opt to the refund as she cause me an unnecessary delay for work because she could have wait a minute long for me to pump the remaining $9.22 worth of gas. I asked for the manager as I would rather grab an item(s) equivalent to the refund that person didn't even come out to try and resolve the customer issue.

Julie Walker,CA,"Sep 2, 2024","That's a -1 starThat's a -1 star. I had to give them something to be able to write this review. The negative star is for a particular store in MacKenzie BC. It's the worst one I've ever had to deal with. I've patronized 7-11in Canada and the USA for at least 40 years and until I moved to this 1 horse town, never experienced such horrible treatment (this doesn't apply to Jobie, Nicole or Andrea) The people are the worst example of customer service, they are rude, they are complete jerks when you want to accumulate points and quickly click off when offers come up to redeem. Why have a point system if you're going to give people a hard time about it. They can't seem to get a system for lining up to pay, people just walk in front of people waiting in line because you never know where to stand. If you've been waiting in line they don't tell the person that just went in front everyone to get to back of line. The manager Tracey is one of the rudest people I've ever dealt with, I have to wonder why these employees choose customer service employment if they are going to treat customers like crap. They don't really have to change because it's the only gig in town. I avoid 711 in MacKenzie as much as possible, but sometimes am forced to going there. If anyone else has bad experiences at this location, don't bother complaining to the manager because she don't care, call head office with your complaint. Like I said I've patronized 711's from Campbell river to Seattle and everywhere in between and I can assure you that MacKenzie 711 is the worst. The employees are nicer in the downtown Eastside in Vancouver. Do better MacKenzie 711, I'm sick of the mistreatment, especially as I spent a lot my hard earned money there as there's no other options, so I'm thinking they think they don't need to be nice to their customers. (There's one other lady and I don't know her name, she has a slight limp and she's a wonderful customer service representative for the store). I had to put today's date, but it's 98% of the time I am forced to go in this particular store. Really pathetic. Date of experience: September 01, 2024",1,Grocery

The card never left my wallet. I checked the account and there were several charges to a 7-Eleven on the opposite side of the country. I am in NJ and the charges were in California. I called American Express and was told that there was nothing that they could do and to call the merchant. I called the merchant 7-Eleven and was told that I had to take it up with the bank. I called American Express AGAIN and the same thing, take it up with the merchant. So I called 7-Eleven one last time and begged the customer service representative to at least look into it because they were used at specific stores. She didn't seem like she wanted to help me, but agreed to listen. She took notes. My boss who gave out the cards also tried to reach American Express without any success. In the end, I received an email from 7-Eleven stating that the case was closed with no reason given. American Express nor 7-Eleven have helped in any way to resolve this issue, despite me giving exact locations and days of when the card was used at 7-Eleven.

Harlem Avenue in Tinley Park on 20 Sep 24 at 5 pm. My work vehicle had over heated upon pulling into the gas station for gas, I parked my vehicle, purchased a snack and then later on a separate receipt I purchased Coolant for $19.74 including taxes.  I sat for 30 minutes and returned with the Coolant to ask the cashier if I should purchase the Peak instead and upon looking at both I placed the peak back on the shelf and returned to my vehicle to use the coolant in hand that I had already purchased. The cashier a male of indian decent, smaller statue started aggressively banging on the window, then another male of the same ethnicity rushes out to tell me to pay for the Coolant; confused and embarrased as there were customers in the store and coming in with all eyes on me. I explained, I purchased this, the cashier begans yelling,  ""you did not, you can not steal and you are a thief."" I go to the car and grab my receipt and he refuses to look at the receipt, still calling me a thief as the store and activity literally stopped. In absolute desperation I attempt to see if a customer would look at the receipt, but of course no one wanted to intervene and I am clear on the why. I walk out as the cashier threatens to call the police and the manager and after the manager who assisted me thirty minutes prior, he no longer recalled the purchase. The cashier is still yelling as I walk out and is then followed by the other person working and even with the receipt with the date and time, I was still humilated, embarassed and accussed of stealing. I finally called the police and after the officer goes into the store, suddenly, the manger who was on another phone remembers me making the purchase. I am 52 years old, a professional, educated, home owner and all of your Mobil team saw was a black person who steals.

Went back to the store and the same guy says come back at 2:00 tomorrow. Tell him I have to work. Calls the owner.

I leave go back to 7-11 and they say nope no refund and called the cops on me. They say you can’t do this, you have to dispute the charge.  When calling Amex they say when disputing a charge step 1. Try to rectify with the retailer first. (Not what police say) 2. We will remove the charge temporarily. We will give the store a chance to prove this dispute is not fraudulent.

I have never put a review online, good or bad, about anything but I am very tired of the way that I am treated when entering a store for gas or other types of items.  There is a store in Jacksonville, Fl that should have reduced patronage based on the customer service and distractions around the store.  I go to this store almost every day and there is always a homeless man, I assume he is homeless or he would be at home instead of sitting outside the 7-11 up against the wall all day long, sitting up against the wall right outside the door.  No one seems to have a problem with this.  Today I saw a woman sitting off to herself on the store property doing what appeared to be talking to herself.  Then I went in the store and bought lottery tickets and cigarettes.  The same cashier who had previously tried to keep a 10 dollar easy match lottery ticket winner from me threw my change across the counter at me.  I asked her why she through my change at me she said i through my money at her.  I placed the money on the counter after verifying the amount needed.  The safety of the customers are in jeopardy and the store should have some revenue reviews based on how they treat customers.  I called the customer service number which lead me to someone in El Salvador.  It was difficult to understand her.  Furthermore, I don't think it makes much sense to have a customer service contact phone number in another country when there are people out of work in the United States based on COVID-19.

I was using my credit card but a card reader#1 didn't work. I tried about few times, then it showed on screen ""pay later"". After I finished filling gas, it costed me totally $47.07. I was going to 7-11 store then, to pay this cost. Honestly, I didn't realized it was charged my credit card already, so I paid it again $47.0 with an store associate. When I reached at my house, I checked with my phone. Two of charge had showed up in my credit card notification. I was surprised Oh my god! I paid double by mistake. So, I went back to store immediately, it's around 6:30 am. I found another associate, his name is JAME. He is a store manager. At that time, I thought it's great! If a store manager is here, everything should be fixed. I asked him for refund though. Unfortunately, he had denied suddenly, not even been listening me clearly what was going on my case. He said he couldn't do because he was not a person who served me at the moment. Even I showed him a receipt though. This is ridiculous what from store manager I've ever heard before.I told him, YES YOU CAN!, NO MATTERS WHO WAS DOING. He opposed and said he was just alone in store, and couldn't do for me. Honestly, I can tell only him and I were in store at that time, nobody else! I told him the same words. He kept denying yet, against and not listening at all.

Chet Manley,US,"Jul 20, 2022","Listen up 711Listen up, or don’t: I have lived down the street from this location for 30 years. Being 30 years old I can confidently All right, listen up: I have lived down the street from this location for 30 years. Being 30 years old I can confidently recollect the last 15 or so. I recently learned that this store had changed hands from the private owner, John, to corporate management. On this here tonight, for the first time in history (as far as I’m concerned) I moseyed on over to the 711 only to find that it was… closed? I thought that this was strange but without much question proceeded to drive a couple two tree streets over to the next 711, on the other side of Schiller Park. Rob Lowe and Behold, this 711 was also mysteriously and inexplicably closed. There was a sign that read “We are sorry for the INCONVINCE.” Chronologically, I drove to the next closest 711, which was only another few couple blocks over, and was immediately relieved to learn that they were wide open for business. I asked the gentlemen working the register: “You must be still be privately owned” to which I received an affirmative reply. this experience disappointed me for several reasons. First and foremost, I manage a corporation that purchases private businesses from family owners looking to sell with confidence that their legacy and brand will remain in good hands. As a purchasing entity, you do everything in your power to reassure a selling owner that the level of customer service they have spent decades establishing and maintaining will not be tarnished. It is incredibly disappointing to see this standard come into freefall in such short order following operational management being assumed by corporate. For roughly the last two decades, if the store was short-staffed, the owner was behind the register, had a broom in his hand, or was stocking shelves. The moment that corporate takes over, any level of ownership or personal responsibility ceases to exist. Whoever the operations manager is for this region should be relieved of their responsibilities, with haste. There is almost no legitimate reason for this to happen. Your payroll and bloated overhead costs are far too expensive to justify the inability to find solutions to operational challenges. For color, I live in the Midwest, and manage roughly 20 individual businesses ranging in location from CA to CO. On several occasions, when there has been no better alternative, I have flown out to these individual locations to fill in gaps and prevent any disruptions in operation.In summation: Do better.Date of experience: July 20, 2022",1,Grocery

Tim Doyle,AU,"Aug 13, 2023","Don't Use The Pay & Go FeatureI feel compelled to share my recent experience with the Pay & Go feature on the My 7-Eleven App, particularly at the Bushland Beach store. What should have been a convenient and seamless process turned into an ordeal that not only disrupted my family's day but also strained our finances and left us emotionally distressed.On 13/08/2023, I tried the Pay & Go feature for the first time while fueling up at the Bushland Beach service station. Unfortunately, the app's malfunction prevented me from finalising the transaction, forcing me to pay for the fuel in person. Later that day, I was left embarrassed and disheartened when my card was declined at the movies due to the unauthorized $100 holding fee, apparently authorized by 7-Eleven.What makes this situation even more disheartening is that not only did the app withhold $100 from my bank account, but I also paid for the fuel in-store due to the app's failure. This double payment compounded the financial hardship brought about by this incident.Despite my efforts to seek assistance at the Bushland Beach store and through the customer care phone line, the responses were inadequate and lacked empathy. This left my family unsupported over the weekend, adding to our distress.The emotional toll of this incident is immeasurable. Beyond the financial strain, the disappointment in my children's eyes and the heavy weight in my heart are reminders of this distressing event.As a loyal customer of the Bushland Beach store and someone who played a crucial role in advocating for its establishment within our community, this experience has been particularly disheartening. The incident contradicts my belief in 7-Eleven's commitment to excellence and customer care.I strongly urge 7-Eleven to address this issue promptly and effectively. The impact of this unfortunate experience extends beyond my family—it has implications for our community's perception of your organization. Urgent resolution is essential to restore our trust and prevent further damage.Date of experience: August 13, 2023",1,Grocery

Absolutely nothing is done to help people to respect social distanciation, the number of people allowed to be inside the shop at the same time should be limited and the cashier should tell customers to stay 1 meter from others customers.Date of experience: March 31, 2020",1,Grocery

Lang was the girl at the register nd was busy reading some paper and the other associate was washing her hands and leaving, went to the register said hi again to Lang still no reply, said it louder and not even looking up at her paper she said “what”  I said I want a chimichanga. She then kept reading her paper not even paying attention to what I said after about 2 minutes she went off to do something I thought she was getting my chimichanga, so when the manager walked up to the register to ask us if we’ve been helped we said yes she was helping us but apparently she wasnt she was putting pizza in the display not getting our chimichanga and she walked up to the register and just looked at us and asked “what do you want” in an already irritated mood I said “like I said a chimichanga” she snapped back and said “dont get an attitude with me little girl” and I replied “well maybe if your customer was good I wouldnt but you had us standing here repeating ourselves multiple times not even greeting us when we first walked up because you’re too busy reading papers and for the second time telling you we want chimichangas” she started babbling that we didnt say anything the store manager had to say her name multiple times to calm her down. Store manager had left, and when she started ringing us up I asked where is your customer service Lang. She then cussed at me saying “you better calm your a**  down bitc* because my customer service is great mmhmm thats why i’ve had this job for 12 yrs” I said oh really you’re an assistant store manager and you are going to cuss at me and talk to me like that.” And she replied “ mmhmm damn right imma cuss at you bitc*” I replied “Doesnt sound very “manager” like of you” in my head I was already furious and thought she’s no manager she must have slept her way to the top cause she doesnt have any customer service or respect. 12 years sounds to me she should find another job cause apparently this one isnt making her happy with her rude obnoxious remarks.Date of experience: September 23, 2019",1,Grocery

I told them I did not want to keep any of them because again I do not like the taste. Then they offered me a 50% discount on the two unopened canisters because the only one that the moneyback guarantee applied to was the first opened canister.  No wonder they want you to buy more than one at a time if they’re only going to refund your money on one.  They also said there would be a 10% return fee.

Pamela Snyder,US,"Jun 8, 2023","Get off the digestive roller coaster!I've reached the point in life that my primary physician is blaming everything on ""the normal aging process"".  Well, I find nothing ""normal"" about constipation. For the last couple of years, my digestive track was on a roller coaster ride of psyllium husk and laxatives. After two weeks with Emma and nothing else, I feel like myself again. After three months, my husband noticed the Emma is the real deal and he is now taking it as well.  His story is a bit different and more dramatic. For the last 20 years, he complained of a constant pain in his side.  He had multiple GI evaluations and more that a few GI doctors told him they could find nothing wrong.  (To which I responded that it must be in his head and maybe they should refer him to a psychiatrist. HA!) However, every time he had to take antibiotics for another ailment, the pain in his side subsided.  Problem is that you can't stay on antibiotics perpetually.From my success, I encouraged him to try Emma. He did and now, six weeks later, he said that he feels better than he has in 20 years!

Carrie,US,"Mar 29, 2024","NIGHTMARE…TO ‘TRY’ & RETURN PRODUCT!  RIDICULOUS!!!Unhappy with product I ‘Attempted’ to call to find out how to return since nothing stated on website.  The number given on the Invoice is useless.  I spent over 1-1/2 hours, called 5 different ‘wrong’ numbers given to me by Representatives, was asked for my Full Credit Card number 3x…(got scared this might be a scam)& name, address etc.  It was extremely difficult to understand the rep & no matter ‘WHAT’ I asked, my question's  weren’t answered.  It was a complete NIGHTMARE!!!.  2 of the ‘Next Tier Customer Service’ numbers I was given were a Communication Co(Frontier I believe) & the other was an ‘Adult Hook Up’ number.  I really felt like the reps intentionally gave me incorrect information.  They continued to pitch other products talking over me as I asked over & over “ Please just tell me how to return the product & get my refund’.  First Rep said she will send me a text & I MUST reply Yes in order to get my Reference # she initially said she was generating then refused to give to me.  I replied Yes to the text & it signed me up for some other product & charged my credit card.  So then I had to call another number of theirs to find out about my credit by giving Reference # AND I had to call another number to cancel the service I was signed up for & charged to cancel (excuse-error in their system).  I had NO luck with with phone number.  If I knew your Customer Service was so horrible, I would never have purchased any product from you.  Your website is vague & I feel your reps are trained to give Consumers the ‘run around’(false numbers & info) so they get frustrated & just keep the product.  Well, I WANT MY MONEY BACK.  Send me an address or call me with Return Instructions your Customer Service is oblivious to.  Some reps didnt even know what ‘Keto Activate’ was.  You give a 30-day money back guarantee BUT make it IMPOSSIBLE to get return Instructions & to find out if & when I’ll receive my money back!🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡Date of experience: March 28, 2024",1,Grocery

Marlene Ll,US,"Updated Dec 4, 2023","BEWAREBEWARE - Something ""hinky"" is going on at this company.  I successfully placed my first order for three bottles with this company many months ago and decided to use the product again.  For three weeks now I have tried to place another order but strange things have happened that I think warrant a ""take care"" warning.  The first re-order attempt saw a successful debit to my charge account and when the order did not arrive a follow-up with ""K"" and my bank showed that they had sent the money back to my bank.  When I called ""K"" I was told to place another order but use another card to make sure that there is no problem with the new order.  Within a few days the second order was refunded to my second bank with no explanation to me or the bank.  Last week I called customer service again and was told that they would place the order from their sales department and send me a payment invoice since I would not give them the card by phone - OH...they told me once again to use a new card.  For the third time in as many weeks the money has been returned again and this time they tell me that their warehouse has flagged my address as being ""fraudulent.""  Since I have received mail at the same address for more than ten years and got their first delivery I asked them to investigate or give me the name of their shipping company. They refused and said it was their warehouse that had flagged me and they would not give me the warehouse manager's name and address so that I could resolve the problem.  They basically indicated via ""Clifford"" that there was nothing they could do ...which leaves me wondering is this some sort of scheme to collect credit card numbers, naturally I will be watching my bank accounts every day because I now have a feeling of distrust in dealing with this company. As of 12/4/23 Additional information requested by the company follows: Order 16122810 placed under husband's name and Order 16046443 placed under my name are the two most recent copies that I have.  There were three orders placed in all within the last two months that were turned back after cashing at the bank.

Wendy Alliman,US,"Mar 4, 2023","The recipes/meal plans are excellent!Eighteen weeks ago I signed up for the year meal plan. Seeing that nothing else has work, decided to give this a try. There is also a one month plan. Although you could keep repeating the same recipes over and over again and still be successful, the yearly plan provides for one year recipes for 3 meals and 1 snack each day. I did not purchase any supplements as I wanted to see how I would do just following the plan. Take the time to be honest when reporting on day 5 of each week. If you actually didn’t eat what was on the week’s menu say so. You’ll notice that by doing so, the menu selection gets more in tune with what you enjoy eating. You’ll be answering questions such as weight, waist measurement, activity level, energy level, if you’ve had cravings, and the percentage of foods that the prepared from the menu. Family  members have enjoyed the recipes, with many not knowing that they are eating keto. Before you really get started in the program, you’ll be invited to a Zoom meeting to go over the program. Take notes. As for the recipes, read the whole recipe, multiple times, as there are tips and alternate baking directions if you do not have the needed equipment, such as a microwave or air fryer, either in the tip section or the comments section. The shopping list is helpful, but it does not list the exact amounts of each ingredient needed. I just review the recipes to ensure that I have not just the needed items, but the quantities needed. Some people print out the recipes; I do not as I can re-access them through the library. You’ll need a cloth tape measure as well as regular scale. Find yourself some kind of exercise that you enjoy and will stick with. It’s part of the process, but not required or forced upon you. If you need an answer to a question, put it into the comment section under a recipe and check back for the answer. They are fairly fast at answering questions, but don’t expect a response as if you are using text or phone. There is also a private FB group that is a supportive group of other individuals in all stages of their weight loss journey. People post pictures of what they’ve been cooking/baking. Please do not demand recipes. It’s part of the group rules. Unfortunately, many people do. The group admin is kind and courteous in reminding everyone that it is up to the original poster as to whether or not they share the recipes. So my experience has been very successful. I have lost so far 30 pounds. This program is a tool that you have to commit to whole heartedly. Don’t go into it “hoping it’ll work.” Date of experience: March 03, 2023",5,Grocery

But dont be fooled.  Baked beans now only 400g, instead of 410 or 415.  And most spreads are now 400g instead of 500?  I reckon middle management treat shoppers like we're stupid.  For example, 2 x 8 packs of Pepsi £6.50 with Nectar - that's over 40p per can! Is that supposed to be a good deal??

In addition the bakery is an absolute joke, almost an afterthought with a tiny counter - bread is tasteless, the Patisserie Valerie section is laughable and nothing at all would entice me to buy any bakery products. Why was the deli taken out? Apparently didn’t make any profit but now nothing fresh.

First, you have to run the gauntlet of loud disco music when you shop there - appalling.Second, I am now filmed as I use the self checkout.  Third, whenever you want to see a manager, you get a 'duty manager', who is no more than any old employee whose turn it is to fill the spot.Fourth, while there is a good range of products, some of the food is definitely sub-standard.  Their tangerines, for example, are either fine or minuscule, impossible to peel without destroying them and taste bitter.  Their Ryvita flatbreads are almost always broken; you cannot see this until you open the package.Fifth, phoning Customer Service is a total waste of time.Sixth, writing a recorded delivery letter to the CEO does not even elicit the courtesy of an acknowledgement, let alone a reply.By contrast, Marks and Spencer across the road is infinitely better but much smaller, without the wide variety of stock.  There's also a Morrison's a short drive away that is also far better, and as I frequently pass this I shall try buying there in the future, if only to avoid the awful disco music.It would be foolish to imagine that any major supermarket cares tuppence about any complaints like these as long as the money keeps rolling in, but at least I have a choice in this area.Date of experience: July 22, 2024",1,Grocery

Grey, wet, cold, not in the mood  for the absurd or the downright stupid. There is a local information board located at the back of the store, to the left of the self-service machines. One of the brain surgeons working here has placed a large soft drinks display up against this board, right in the centre, completely obscuring most of the adverts. Kind of defeats the object, yes? What makes this even more idiotic, is that they should simply have placed the display about 18 inches to the left against a bare patch of wall - leaving the board clear for the public to read - whilst still maintaining a prominent position visible to customers in the queue, or walking to the till point. Basic retail common sense. Should I be working in this clown show? They couldn't afford me. Local people use this opportunity to advertise activities and services which benefit the community, therefore, this is embarrassing. For all of you.Date of experience: February 22, 2023",1,Grocery

I was happy to leave my details and phone with them as I it wouldn't take more than 10 mins. At which point her response ""if you take your car i will call the police "" to which I said i totally understand but is there another way you can help me as I don't know what else to do as you have seen and she said ""well noone else has had an issue with paying"" so i said I'm willing to show you my bank account to prove I have the funds to which she said "" I don't like your attitude"" baring in mind I'm asking for help not being abusive just trying to come to a resolution. I then said to her I don't know what else to do and Angela then says ""that's your problem not mine"" I then asked for a manager to be told she didn't have a manager and I could go to the store.  Her colleague then helped me by taking my details on the back of receipt paper and I went off home to get my bank cards, I came back to pay but couldn't pay using contact less but could by using chip and pin. I noticed at this point other people were having similar issues. I then went to the store and spoke to a manger who told me they have a process for this kind of thing and all she had to do was ask me to fill in a non payment form at no point was this offered to me. I was spoken to like dirt, treated as if I was trying to get out of paying. Angela's attitude was disgusting.

The last time I was there I bought, what I thought were nectar deals and was surprised that the check out prices were so high. But I thought maybe I'd made a mistake. Yesterday I made proper notes of items. I discovered at the Check out that whilst prices said 'reduced' on shelf if bought with a nectar card, it wasn't true at all. Even when I questioned it, the shop staff actually said I needed to remove a sticker that said reduced and look below!

My nose is still burning.* All three of the urinals are out of service, two have been covered for over a week, the third is brimming with stale urine. * Of two toilet cubicles, only one is in use. (Again, this is over a week out of service) The useable cubicle has toilet rolls just dumped, unhygienically on the floor and on a pipe!* The washing basin facility is useable but is extremely broken down.I have pictures to back up this review.This is NOT the standard I would expect from a major store and would suggest that this could be a very powerful deterrent to people visiting the store since, if Sainsbury's are happy to display this level of care to their customers, how much care goes on behind the scenes with the storage and handling of the food and other items?Date of experience: October 29, 2023",1,Grocery

Next, she directed me to an area whereby there were more Easter eggs for the ages of the children I was buying for. Despite the enormous task of rearranging just about the entire two eggs sections, Gersina had the warmest of smiles that would have defused even the most irate customer having a meltdown. I shared the information she'd offered me with other customers that acknowledged just how disappointed they might well have been had they not come across that section of eggs. So, thank you Gersina for doing I guess what you always do while on shift.Date of experience: April 07, 2023",5,Grocery

Senior staff member present confirmed I had selected the correct items for the £5 meal deal, so I went to the checkout.Items came to £10.23!  Assistant on the checkout knew that was incorrect so asked the senior colleague for help.  The senior colleague went off to look at the shelf and never came back!

I am being woken on a regular basis by the grocery delivery vans any time between 6.30am and 7.30am on a weekend. These are not deliveries to people who are disabled but to a big young man who lives a few doors away. It is a cul de sac and I live on the corner so even moving my bedroom to the back would not help. First I have the caw caw as the van turns round then banging doors, banging crates and crates being wheeled to the delivery location and then everything in reverse. I have also heard loud conversations where the driver is having a nice chat with the customer. This is with my double glazed windows closed, so it will be even worse when I need to have windows open. These deliveries are used by customers to save themselves about £1 at the expense of their neighbours' sleep. Covid restrictions are over and there is no need for the early deliveries. I have lived for over 6 decades without the need for them and I have worked shifts! Calls to Sainsbury to complain make no difference and when asked to be quieter the drivers couldn't care less. Unacceptable. Ruining my sleep and woken with palpitations due to the sudden noises. Thanks Sainsbury.

I have always enjoyed shopping at the various stores and interacting with the friendly staff.Unfortunately, in my experience, this has changed.  Two times in the last three months I have left the store after I disagree with a procedure or something else with a member of staff and then 2 or 3 others join in, gossiping amongst themselves and even shouting over at me from other tills.  On the last occasion one of the managers was so rude that when I told him I was going to complain he refused to give me his name and walked off.After my last experience I waited to speak to one of the senior store managers and explained that I have a disability, albeit one that isn't visible.  That being shouted at and confronted by more than 1 member of staff is intimidating and triggering and likely to result in a hostile reaction.  He apologised and said to phone in with my complaint.  I did so and was told that staff should be more aware and certainly shouldn't be grouping together against you.  That staff, one in particular, would receive training.  I'm not sure if that has happened, but that same member of staff came over to join in again.  My disability means that I struggle with going out at the best of times.

No signal, the joke is they even have the self scan thingies so you scan everything as you go round but because there's no signal in the store it cant connect to your app and it takes for ever. But mostly, this shop is so badly stocked. Always runs out of milk and bread, items which show on the nectar app as on offer very often are not in the kelso store. WHY!?. Offers are always understocked anyway, because its in a tourist area it stocks too many tacky nonsense camping food items and forgets that this is one of only 2 supermarkets servicing the entire area within a 20 mile radius if not more! Stop prioritising seasonal tourists and think about the people who need to use it all year round! All the locals would prefer an ALDI or TESCO in its place trust me, but we are stuck with it.

GB News provides a much-needed alternative perspective in the mainstream media landscape, and it is concerning to see a major retailer like Sainsburys cave in to pressure and attempt to silence a legitimate news outlet. Boycotting GB News not only goes against the principles of free speech and diversity of thought, but it also alienates a significant portion of their customer base who value the content and reporting provided by GB News.

David G.,GB,"Dec 4, 2023","How come every time I come here, there is a problem with the self-service till? I don't know, I didn't make the tills.Sainsbury branch on Lewes RoadSainsbury branch on Lewes Road, Brighton. As is so often the case at this branch, insufficient staff on duty. At 3.30pm only one staff member helping with the 20 or so self-service tills and a queue to reach these. There were manned tills open, three rather than the usual one or two, but these were busy with folks with big trolley loads and queues of their own.As I approached the self-service tills, I despondently left behind a bottle of alcohol, as buying alcohol requires two attendances by the staff - one to approve the bottle and confirm customer is over 18, the second to remove any security tagging. In doing this, I hoped to save time in the self-service area, knowing how busy the single staff member can get.Yet, lo and behold, half-way through scanning my items, the machine played up, the red light came on and the sign ""Remove item from basket"" shone out accusingly. I adjusted the position of the basket/products and removed the last item scanned but this made no difference. I had a frozen item I wanted to get home asap, too. But had to wait nearly 10 minutes till the staff member came to my end of the check-out area. (By now, the till next to me also had a red light.)There was no fault in my usage, just the usual joy of the machine playing up. When, I said, ""How come every time I come here, there is a problem with the self-service till?"", the reply I got was a cursory and sarcastic, ""I don't know, I don't make them."" This smart-ass rudeness and lack of care passes as wit and an appropriate response among the 20 year-old members of staff at this sad branch of the supermarket. In a previous experience, I wanted the staff to approve some alcohol. Oh, we can only approve it at the end of your shop. ""Why?"", said I, ""If Tesco can approve it mid-way through the shop, why can't you?"". Clearly, I was trying to save time as the staff was nearby. ""Oh, it's not our problem if Tesco does it differently"", was the unhelpful response.I draw the following conclusions:1. There needs to be more staff on duty at the self-checkout areas.2. Staff need training in appropriate and sympathetic responses to customers' problems with the technology. 3. The machines need renewing. A long-standing member there has told me the machines are by now very old and every single one of them has a fault(s).Some of the products at Sainsbury state ""Aldi Price Match"".

ChK,GB,"Oct 31, 2022","Appalling customer servicePoor customer service and zero regard for customer interest. Staff doesn’t think twice about inconveniencing customers, as long as it serves the staff. One Sunday I spent ages helping an elderly lady with her trolley full of shopping because exits from the shop to the carpark were closed ached off the store closure time. The lady had to get out on the street and walk from one outside lift to another (all broken) to get to the carpark. At the same time a group of staff were chatting and laughing near the door, killing time until 4pm. I later found out that it was a standard practice to lock doors to the carpark ached of time. Shopping trolleys are faulty and often the wheels get blocked at the lifts. I’ve seen it happened a few times and it has just happened to me. I was not allowed to pick up my bags and go, despite explaining that I had a medical appointment in a few minutes. I was threatened by a staff member, younger than my child, that she would call security guards if I didn’t wait with the trolley. I wanted to leave the shopping so I wouldn’t miss my appointment but this was not allowed either. I had to wait a while before the wheels were unblocked and I was allowed to go. I arrived late for my appointment. There had been numerous issues, mainly with a very poor customer service. On one occasion I purchased a mouldy pitta bread (still within expiry date), on another occasion 4 packs of Sainsbury’s organic spoiled tofu (also within expiry date). I informed the customer service, provided photos, only to be interrogated like a criminal. I gave up and just binned the tofu. The pitta bread was eventually replaced, but not before naïve questioning, which was really humiliating. On another occasion there were no trolleys available at all. I informed one of the aimlessly wandering staff about it and decided not to wait for the trolley. I finished my shopping, paid and there were still no trolleys, and another person was asking for them. This is the first time I looked at Trustpilot reviews and was shocked that 70% are negative comments. I could not find any responses from Sainsbury’s, which only confirms that they do not care about customers at all. I used to do almost all my food shopping at Sainsbury's for many years, but in recent years not so much, even it is the closest food store. I think I will be avoiding them all together from now on.Date of experience: October 31, 2022",1,Grocery
Alexander,GB,"Jan 30, 2024","""Sainsbury'sSainsbury's: High Prices, Questionable Dry Goods Quality""Sainsbury's: High Prices, Questionable Dry Goods Quality""As a frequent shopper, I've come to know Sainsbury's quite well, and if I had to rate my overall experience, it would reluctantly hover around a 7 out of 10. Unfortunately, this score is more due to a lack of negative incidents rather than the presence of positive ones, as the service rarely ventures beyond mediocrity.The food selection, while marginally better than what you might find at the average supermarket, fails to impress. It's a stretch to consider it excellent or to classify any item as truly top-tier. While there are occasional bursts of quality, they are the exception rather than the rule, leaving much to be desired for those with a discerning palate.A particularly sore point is the quality of Sainsbury's dry goods. Even when these items are well within their use-by dates, their quality can be hit-or-miss. This inconsistency is a point of contention, especially when compared to other supermarkets, which seem to uphold a higher standard of quality control for their non-perishable products.The pricing strategy at Sainsbury's is, bluntly put, disproportionate to the quality of goods on offer. The premium pricing would be justifiable if the products were exceptional, but as it stands, the value proposition is lacking. Other supermarkets have demonstrated that it is possible to offer better or comparable quality items at more reasonable prices, which puts Sainsbury's at a disadvantage in the market.In summary, Sainsbury's seems to be content with being slightly above average, but for customers paying premium prices, this complacency is a disservice. The store needs a rigorous review of both its pricing strategy and quality control, particularly for its dry goods. Only then can it hope to justify its prices and elevate its service beyond the current plateau of mediocrity.---Date of experience: January 30, 2024",3,Grocery

paul tapner,GB,"May 18, 2023","The apathy of early morningI will give Sainsbury this. They are convenient. I visit the main one in Poole regularly because it's on my way to work and that allows me to get in there at 7am when it opens. Avoiding crowds later in the day. Trouble is you seem to be an inconvenience if you do that. Staff are all shelf filling, so you feel like you're getting in the way. Only rarely do they say good morning. Because they're all shelf filling there's never a manned till. So you have to use self service. And the machines when they've just come on will often just freeze and not do anything. Tell the staff this and they say in an apathetic tone 'oh they're really slow first thing in the morning.' Well thanks for caring. If I encountered a problem where I work I would tell the customer what I was going to do to get it fixed. And I would make it so. In fact the other week I heard two staff talking about how people come in to look at the machines and fix them. Go away. And nothing gets done.On this particular occasion I was using a self service till, because of course there was no manned one and no staff in sight. When I put my bank card in to pay absolutely nothing would happen. It said someone is coming to help you. Nobody did. I saw one member of staff walk past nearby clearly totally oblivious. After four tries with my card getting the same message to no avail for four mins I moved to the next till and did it there and it worked fine. I have filled in umpteen customer feedback forms about this issue. I have written to their complaints department twice. But nothing ever changes.So they're ok to shop with, if you don't do it first thing. But don't waste your time on customer service feedback. Because it's clearly ignored. And if you do go in later in the day you will find the second lot of self service tills are more often than not closed. So what's the point in having them?Date of experience: May 16, 2023",2,Grocery

Daren  Hart,GB,"Jun 22, 2023","Representatives of Sainsbury's WhitechapelBefore I eventually Got to Speak with the Duty Manager, I was lied to by the Member of Staff on Duty in Customer Services two-fold, Firstly I was told the Person I wanted to bring the matter to the Duty manager about by being told as if The Customer Services Staff’s Opinion about the Matter was of any Importance for me to Be Dealing with the Duty Manager including The Staff’s Blatantly Lying that such a Person Worked in that Branch and then after another Staff Member of that Store had Made it Perfectly Clear there was always a Duty Manager Present in Store at all Times, he Lied by telling Me No Duty Manager was in the Store. Then I was asked by the Supervisor of Self Service Tills why I wanted to See the Manager (it had nothing to do with him, and was None of His Business), I had Asked Jim Exceedingly Politely for his Assistance in Knowing Where I Could Find the Duty Manager, especially so as the person who was at Customer Services Desk had just Blatantly Lied to Me!I Decided to walk Away from the Ignorant Staff, to Avoid becoming any more Irate due to Being Treated so Badly! I found a Very helpful Chap who was pushing a Cafe of Supplies to Refill Shelves in Store, if He Knew where the Duty Manager was, he Looked about a pointed me to an Isle with a Very Tall Strong Burley Looking Man was attending some Shelves, I approached and Asked if he wa the Duty Manager (later I asked for His Name and was told it was Raj).I Explained from the Beginning once again, as to how a Supervisor Named “Shira” had been both Rude in her manner and Actions on the Behalf of Sainsbury’s Superstores, a young Lass at 1413 that day had Asked her if they would Report that White Seedless Grapes I had bought the Previous Night Reduced by 46p to £1.84 from £2.30 with a Best Before Date of 25th of June were Actually Rotting , that I Could not see this when I purchased them, and only Found Out When I opened the Pack and had started to eat them, during this 2 absolutely disgusting Greyish Grapes Fell out from the midst of the Bunch into the Plastic Tray/Pack I Bought them in! Shira had look with barely a fleeting glance and responding to the Young Lass with only a Sideways Nodding of her Head, in the Negative, I seeing this Asked of Shira if she was Sure as I didn’t Believe Sainsbury’s would want their Reputation to be of Selling Seedless White Grapes in date that were Actually Rotting, Shira simply Nodded Vertically without a Word Indicating She was Sure that nothing would be Done Nor Did She Care, I said Fine I will be making a Formal Complaint as I far From agreed with her Conduct or Perspective as a to Sainsbury’s Good Name ( I have Shopped at 1 Cambridge Heath Road, Since mid-80s and Never Seen the Staff Represent Sainsbury’s Superstores this way!I went on to Explain to Raj (Duty Manager the Night of 21st June 2023) as to how the Customer Services Desk Staff had Acted, with Great Detail! Then I went on To Explain how the Self Service Tills Supervisor had Responded to my Request for the Duty Manager’s Whereabouts, Raj at this point Confirmed my Perspective of Sainsbury’s Superstores, as they had never Before in his Experience Deliberately Sold Rotting Food of Any Description, and that he wasn’t just saying this Because of himself be the Duty Manager, but as Someone Akin to Myself who had Always Shopped at Sainsbury’s Superstores and Never Known the Likes of this to have Occurred, I have Never had this happen in all the Years i.have been Shopping at any of Sainsbury’s Stores, so Could Fully Appreciate his Comments!Raj (Duty Manager) said he would deal with this Matter and be bringing it to the Attention of the Day Manager, which I thought meant he was taking it Seriously, however as a Female Store Staff Member was walking up the Isle Contrary to his Response to my Mention Shira’s Name made out to her as though he had Never Heard of Shira Before as he asked do you know anyone called Shira (exactly the way the Customer Services Desk Staff had done) I pointed out to Raj (Night Duty Manager) that he had only moments ago Acknowledged Knowing of Shira and Asked why he was now Pretending not to Have Even Heard of Her, he made out that I had Misunderstood Him!When he said he was going to deal with this Matter making Sure the Day Duty Manager Knew about all that had Occurred, he Said some Rather Foolish things as to how he would find out who had been on Duty at the Customer Services Desk, and also who was on Duty at the Self Service Tills as Supervisor!

How disappointing that all the fresh produce had a max of 2 days to expiry date meaning I’ve had to throw most away and have no means of replacing. I am now reliant on family shopping for us instead when I ordered plenty for the week. I tried to complain to customer services to be told in no uncertain terms that policy is fresh produce is acceptable as long as it is sent with 2 days left until the best before date?! My complaint cannot be escalated and my only other option is to write and post a physical letter to head office. Hardly ideal when I’m isolating.

Why didn’t I read these reviews prior to placing an order? I could cope with the shorter life dates on some items but after opting for NO substitutes, I was frustrated to find that my choice of English lamb steaks hadn’t been delivered and I received New Zealand instead. I phoned customer services immediately to state that I had opted out of the substitute items only to be told that ‘You don’t get a choice of where the meat is sourced! I asked him to explain why if that’s the case, you specifically show a picture of English lamb- Union Jack on the packaging to boot! After referring to his supervisor, he told me that I should read the small print under the item. By the way, I’ve done this since and at no point does it state you cannot choose between English or New Zealand lamb. He then informed that they wouldn’t be able to refund for this reason. To be honest, I wasn’t quibbling the £4 odd cost. It was more the frustration and inconvenience caused. He then asked me why I didn’t want New Zealand lamb!! I thought this was irrelevant and none of his business or telling him about carbon footprints but decided to be completely honest and tell him that my family can ‘Taste the Difference’ ironic eh! We find English lamb leaner, sweeter and a totally different flavour.I honestly think this falls under the Trades Description Act!Needless to say that I sent an email complaint on Monday and still haven’t received a response!

The day in question was actually a day when it didn't snow and the roads were now clear of snow. I telephoned the number on the email and when I got through was told it was because the drivers couldn't get to work due to snow! Very surprising as I managed to get to work  in the NHS during the heavy snow! I was then offered a click and collect slot again surprising since the weather was too bad for their drivers to get to work but it was ok for me to get there! I was eventually given a delivery slot for 5 days later.I sent an email to their CEO explaining my disappointment in their service. I received a very stock email response from their executive office. Basically these things happen, sorry! Well I will not be shopping with Sainsbury's any more.

It never showed up, no contact from Sainsbury, until an email telling me my refund had been processed. My food order money was back in my account so I called customer service out of confusion and got told bad weather had prevented deliver, which I accepted because of heavy snow. I went back onto my banking app to find they had taken my order money back.  Luckily I had the foresight to have an order booked for last night and redid my food order. My groceries were due between 21.40 and 22.40 last night. 23.15 and no delivery and no contact from Sainsbury's. Called customer service and was told the driver was running 60 to 90 minutes behind and could I wait up please? I stated that I had watched 3 Tesco vans and an Asda van deliver groceries to my neighbours today, so wont be accepting bad weather as the excuse this time. 01.00 this morning and no delivery, no contact either. Called customer service this morning to be told they had no idea why I my groceries weren't delivered and ""whatever, click and collect next time"". Since Monday I have called Sainsbury 6 times. The first agent was apologetic and helpful. The last one was too. But the 4 invetween treated me disgustingly. I explained I was suffered a brain aneurysm which left me with permanent cognitive problems and I can no longer drive. I explained I am very isolated where I live and don't have the £50 round trip taxi fare to click and collect. I explained I am facing a severe food crisis with 2 young children in the house. I explained I also can't work and have very little income and can't rectify their mistake unless they refund my grocery order and not keep holding on to it. Their replies to these statements were ""I'm not listening anymore, have a good day"". ""Go annoy someone else"" and ""go to a food bank"" then having the phone put down on me. I changed to using Sainsbury because I got tired of Asda only delivering half of what I ordered every week. Now I can see that I made the biggest mistake ever, trusting a supposed major supermarket with my essential needs. Never again.

Booked slot on 25th Jan for delivery on 8 Feb. On morning of 8th email said three items substituted and we’ll see you soon between 12-1pm. 4pm came so tried calling (took 1 hour and gave up) called Dundee and a home worker said my card didn’t go through ( not true) then changed to say they were trying to contact a backlog ( 431 customers) . They have two numbers and email address for me. Surely from 25 Jan I was high up list. I contacted Head Office three times - automated reply surprise surprise! We live in an isolated Glen and track to our house blocked with snow but told Sainsbury’s main road clear but I’ve arranged to get someone to meet delivery van on main road wherever it suited them . Everyone was on standby.  Snow again today  and as yet no word from Head Office. I’ve shopped with Sainsbury’s for years and started on line 2 years ago due to poor health. I know us oldies are are clogging the world up and accept but we have to eat. My daughter tweeted them & their reply was I’d get a refund( none needed) . We can’t eat a refund and now they’ve landed us in the proverbial as registered as Government high risk category with Sainsbury’s. We have a stock of food always but have to top up larder regularly as it does dwindle. If we lived in town we could click and collect for someone to pick up but impossible in a country area.

Sheila McGrory,GB,"Jan 19, 2021","Dreadful service at all levelsI have had mixed fortunes with Sainsbury's - there have been some fantastic staff & experiences and some not so much. Last week I placed my weekly online order & duly waited on its arrival with my own bags sitting at the door to decant into from the crates (There's a whole other issue there but I digress). My slot was between 2 and 3 o'clock. I received an email at 2.50 to advise my order had been cancelled ""due to adverse weather"". The weather that day was not great but my gripe was in receiving this notification so late in the day. I got the usual email advising of what products would be missing from my delivery early on in the day when the weather was much worse so it makes no sense to me that a judgement call was not made much earlier in the day also. 🤷🏼‍♀️ In addition, they send a text message every week the day before my delivery, and if this had been done about the cancellation too,I would have picked up the message much quicker. It was well after three before I checked my emails to see if there was anything amiss. I had made a special trip in the morning to obtain the items I was advised would be missing. I could have just done the whole shop then but I was not aware of their decision. The email also gave a number to contact Customer Services - which I did  (the customary ridiculously long telephone queueing system ensued) thinking that they would be able to re-arrange for me but the short version was no. They don't keep emergency slots for people who have been let down - never mind have the technology to transfer your order details over.The only thing the adviser could do was log my concern and pass it on and even she had to agree that this was shoddy service! Almost a week later I am still waiting on a response from that avenue.In addition, I sent an email to the CEO, Mr Simon Roberts, who hasn't bothered responding even via one of his ""minions"" although he did send me an email (and everybody else probably) on the 12th urging me to help ""keep everybody safe"" when visiting stores.Point being, I had to make yet another trip the next day to get the remainder of my items; so more risk under the current conditions, etc. which would have been unnecessary if my delivery had been made .This just says to me that poor service is endemic from the top down so if you expect good service, seamless delivery when due plus proper communication - don't use Sainsbury's............Date of experience: January 19, 2021",1,Grocery

It had a ""use by"" date of 26 December and was kept carefully refrigerated as per the instructions until  Christmas morning when it was taken out ready to be cooked.  Upon removing the plastic wrapping the smell from the turkey was disgusting and it was covered in a yellow slime.  There was absolutely no way was this going to be cooked and eaten - it went straight in the bin.  Result - a disappointed family and a Christmas dinner devoid of its main component.  As if 2020 hadn't been bad enough.And this from Sainsbury's, the ""holier than thou"" retailer that never stopped telling us in its adverts  leading up to Christmas what a caring socially-responsible organisation it was and all the enormous lengths it was going to ensure that we would be safe from Covid if we visited its stores.  Not only that but all its ridiculous posturing over socio-political causes such as Black Lives Matter and its controversial TV adverts .Here's a thought, Mr Mike Coupe, CEO,  and your Executive Team.  Why not concentrate on selling good quality food that won't put your customers in hospital with food poisoning instead of trying to appease the liberal elite with your ludicrous politicised advertising campaigns and your ""right-on"" messages and emails.

Over the last couple of months my local Sainsbury's has become absolutely diabolical when it comes to home delivery. Delivery drivers are rude and inconsiderate, despite knowing the customer is disabled/vulnerable and needs assistance with the delivery. The order pickers send products that are damaged beyond use and/or have shelf life of less than 24 hours, and also send absolutely RIDICULOUS substitutes. When you call to complain you're met with rude and aggressive staff who make you out to be a liar and talk to you as if you're stupid, then do all they can to avoid refunding you for the money you've wasted trusting them with a weekly food shop. I have a disabled/vulnerable account with them too, so they should know that the food they send is essential and is required to last at least a week since we can't get out to the store to buy replacements nor afford a follow up delivery. The fact they treat their customers in most need so terribly speaks volumes. I've lodged complaints with them about the service, and every time I'm told someone will be in touch, but no manager ever contacts me. It's clear they simply do not care any more, obviously because they don't need to have respect/concern for individual shoppers since they're making money hand over fist from the pandemic. Disgraceful company and looking at the reviews here it's not just a local problem. Wouldn't hurt for their practices to be exposed in the national press, if you ask me.

After a few seconds of seeming uncomprehending silence, the non-sequiter question was put to me, asking me if I was ""Ordering anything"" from Sainsbury's, to-day !?! ?Having had my reasons for calling ignored, I repeated my request again: the 'phone was put down on me.So, I 'phoned again, sat through the same pushbutton responses, was whistled at again, for a few minutes, and the 'phone was answered. I had to repeat it all again, of course; this time, a more helpful man answered; listened; corrected my details; but confirmed that there was another ! wrong element to the address, on the screen. He gave me Customer Services' 'phone number to call, and said it was their fault, not Nectar's; even though the letter was from 'Nectar',  'P O Box 16, Alston'.

When I complained, I was told to read the 'small print' and to return the unsatisfactory bottles to my 'local' store.

How wrong I was. There was so many problems with the card I finally ended up with credit on the card. Not much I might add. I have had the outstanding credit on it since May, 6 months ago but as their customer service was not functioning at all and I was therfore unable to use this card as they did not allow me to use the credit on line my credit was unobtainable.  It's now middle of October and I have again spent hours going around in circles. Finally spoke to Nicci Nelson and she insisted it was credited to a gift card and emailed me but it was not. I tried to explain to her but she kept blaming me. This is after many calls last week and holding for ages today. Finally she said she would send it again (as they failed to send it last week),I asked her specifically NOT to send PDF but she ignored my request and did. She clearly is working in the wrong department and suddenly got agitated when I called her out for doing the opposite to that which I requested she slammed the phone down on me. I then tried to register the card on line but true to their technology problems there is no actual security question which it requires to register. The drop down menu offers nothing. If you attempt to move on it says ...please fill in the security question. I spent around 30 min on this their technology glitch  but sadly it is so bad it is a waste of time. I then phoned the egift card section again and after a long wait had a lovely lady Suzanne tell me they will return my money.

Rob Hindle,GB,"Updated Aug 15, 2020","Can't find a way to complain that worksOn Wednesday we picked up a click and collect order  from Archer Rd Sheffield store. Having been disappointed with previously purchased oranges we opted to pay the premium for ""Taste the difference"" fruit. Got home to find one completely rotten and growing fur.  Tried to email them, can't find a complaints dept. email address. Their website directed me to use FB Messenger, tried that last night and again this morning.  No response.  That may be my fault, first time I've tried to use messenger so,  Sainsbury's, it's a poor channel of communication to rely on if there's a learning curve for customers and particularly so for the elderly who may not use social media. (The same applies to Twitter which they also suggest using). I know they'd like customers to phone but I can't send a photo that way. I don't want to spend 15 minutes listening to canned music (I charge my customers £60/hour so that wait alone represents a ""lost opportunity"" cost of £15) and be told every minute the ""your call is important to us"" (but not sufficiently important to answer the phone...). Contact means shouldn't be THEIR choice but that of the customer.  (And I try to avoid anything that involves Facebook.)  The reason for one star the inability to contact them through messenger or email.UPDATEI observe that most large organisations (and very many smaller ones) monitor TrustPilot reviews and make a serious effort to rectify issues raised.  Looking through the two TrustPilot accounts for Sainsbury's (supermarket) it seems they are happy to disregard all those unhappy customers.I mentioned ""lost opportunity cost"" earlier, well on that basis Sainsbury's now owe me several hundred pounds.My conclusion: Sainsbury's have realised that if you make it hard enough to complain customers will give up, write it off to experience and will forget about their bad experience in a few weeks time. As for those that don't?  Perhaps Sainsbury's view that as a win-win situation for them. No need to waste the time, effort and cost to address the issue.  Maybe Sainsbury's will lose a ""problem customer"" who can go and be a nuisance to a competitor and waste *their* time, effort and money.I take the other view: that an unhappy customer will typically tell ten friends and family and multiply the damage.  That's certainly what I'll be doing and I suggest you do the same.While I'm here, another small gripe. If you order an item that's on offer and the delivery slot is after that offer expires you pay full price.  I think the offer price should be locked in at the time of order.  Sainsbury's prefer to claw back what is sometimes just a few pennies.  Is that legal?Date of experience: August 13, 2020",1,Grocery

Along with the fact that you rarely send the correct orders it seems like your staff simply want to put anything in the delivery to fulfil the requirements. They deliver her shopping without bags and watched an elderly slumped over lady have to unpack her stuff one by one on the doorstep. (I guess compassion is not a requirement for Sainsbury’s)I have called up about the situation seven times. Three of which I have been told an online manager will call me back the following day and has not made contact. A message to head office has been sent a message for the online manager x3 has been left and many many more phone calls.  The worst thing is the last time I called the individual that picked up the phone stated they were aware of the situation but yet no one had called me back!!!!!!!!( this can’t be denied as calls are recorded)I am shocked and appalled that a woman’s dignity has been defiled and it is not a priority for the online manager to call and resolve the situation especially as Sainsbury’s appeal to that age group of people. Add that to the fact that my grandmother is so loyal to the shop they are losing a lifetime customer.

Her name is Ang and she works at the Rite Aid on the Carlisle Pike in Mechanicsburg, PA. My husband had been in the emergency room earlier in the day. The emergency room had submitted a prescription a different Rite Aid that was unable to fill the prescription. I then called the Rite Aid in Mechanicsburg and, although the medicine was not in stock at her location either, Ang took the time to help me track down a Rite Aid location that had stock on hand. She also took the time to explain how to have the original Rite Aid record the prescription so I could pick it up at a different location. My recent experience with pharmacists has been that they are too busy to provide specialized attention. I'm sure Ang was very busy too, but that didn't stop her from giving exceptionally great service.Date of experience: October 05, 2024",5,Grocery

Morgantown Resident,US,"Jan 7, 2023","Rite Aid lied about receiving script from doctor's officeDoctor's office sent script in for my husband for his Parkinson's Disease, a medication, that he MUST have. Rite Aid claimed it didn't get the script.  Was it faxed in or called in she asks us. Then Rite Aid tells me to not yell over the phone, who's yelling? If you don't believe their lies, you're told you are being rude to them.  Then she blames technology, like who believes that excuse.  She lied to us about getting the script because twice we called the doctor's office and twice, they said they sent it in once by phone call, then by fax. Then we get a computer call back from Rite Aid telling us that they don't carry the medication requested. So apparently they did get the script from the Doctor's office.

In order to see your prescriptions you need a number. When you transfer them, you HAVE no number, therefore you don't know when they need to be refilled because without the number you can't see them. Nor can you list them You have to call the pharmacy and have them provide the list for you.Nor do they notify you when they are refilled. Their web site is a cautionary tale of what not to do.

If they are going to offer the delivery then they should stand by it and at least call the people who are expecting their meds to be brought to them!

However over the last few months our Rite Aid in Tallmadge, Ohio has turned into the worst pharmacy to deal with. I am recovering from surgery and can't drive at the moment and I needed to talk to the pharmacist about some reactions I was having. I called for 3 days several times a day and they wouldn't answer their phone. I had to call the assistant store manager and she had to go tell them to pick up their phone. When my husband stopped to pick up my prescriptions they weren't ready and said to come back in 2 hours. He went back in 2 hours and one was missing. He asked them to fill it. The pharmacy assistant said no we would have to come back the next day. The explanation given was that they wer closing. This was at 8 pm and the pharmacy is open until 9. She wouldn't give a reason or look into why it hadn't been filled. Then she started just making up excuses and telling him how she should be spoken to. He went in and the pharmacist unwilling explained the situation with a bunch of attitude. I called and left a message for the store manager because I really wanted to let her know what had happened. I am not someone who calls and complains but 3 days of not answering the phone then this is just ridiculous. I understand why the company is struggling with my experience as well as all the reviews I read on here. Rite Aid has gone downhill and I am definitely switching to another pharmacy.Date of experience: September 21, 2023",2,Grocery
Dee,US,"Nov 19, 2021","Multiple complaints and opinion…My first complaint is about being given wrong information that my prescription would be held for me one day beyond the holding time but when I drove to pick it up, it wasn't. My second complaint is that they automatically filled my recurring prescriptions that I didn't authorize. My third complaint is when wanting to get a covid test, as a senior citizen without tech knowledge needing to schedule an appointment online, when I told them I couldn't figure it out, they just directed me to the library for help and abruptly ended the call. In my opinion they have gotten so big and couldn't care less about their customers because they know insurance companies have selected them as the sole pharmacy that millions of people can use.Date of experience: November 19, 2021",1,Grocery

I was threatened to have my prescription canceled and to go to another  pharmacy after I came in to pick up a refill that was promised to be ready Friday morning. I had to go out of town and was pressed for time, but he said my refill was going to the end of the line and was forced to wait 3 1/2 hours, and he told me if I didn't be quiet and leave he would cancel it and I would have to get a new one from my Dr's office and take it somewhere else!! Then he refused to call my insurance to get a travel override so I had to pay 174.00 in cash. When I reported this to the 800 # I got a call back from the district office saying I could get a customer service refund that day, so I went back to the store and the ""manager "" on duty refused to give a refund saying I'm not giving you 174.00 in ""free "" money, then he called me a F-----g scumbag and a liar on the way out. Next day I called the 800 # again, tell another woman from the pharmacy what happened and there was no apology this time, no lip service, just irritated that I was still bothering them and she told me that I would get nothing, and it was just my fault and my problem. I think this company is so used to dis respecting and insulting customers that they believe they can do and say whatever they want with no consequences. NO INTEGRITY whatsoever.

My husband was not able to pick it up until Saturday and when he did they had filled my inhaler for a $50 copay after I had just picked my inhaler up two weeks prior to this. They did not have my Metformin ready!! They said they called my Doctor but evidently did not check to see if the Metformin Rx was filled. They instead just filled the Rx for what they say was a computer automatic refill for the inhaler - evidentally my Doctor was never called!!   I was angry having to shell out another $50 copay for a RX that I would not need for a couple more weeks and still did not have my metformin!  Of course my Doctor's office was closed today and it was impossible to get my Metformin filled today even though they told me to take it up with my Doctor if the refill was wrong.  The head Pharmacist, Michael, implied I must be senile and maybe forgot how many doses I had used of my inhaler since I still had two weeks worth and by his account I should have been out.  He said I picked up the Rx a month ago.  Which I did not do since I still had two weeks puffs left in my inhaler.  Anyway he is suppose to give me 8 pills emergency since my Doctor office was closed. He promised I could pick up the Metformin tomorrow on Sunday at any register. Hopefully this is true.  Once they even gave me someone else's pills. Yes they are going to kill someone since they are so busy they are not following up or double checking with the client when they fill Rx's.  Michael said they are too busy to do that.

He was filling his prescriptions on the way home to rest. We stopped at the rite aid on butler st in Lawrenceville. I live near by and I generally have no issues there. The manager, Cory DiCarlo, is always friendly and helpful. Anytime I use the pharmacy, which is monthly, it has been without issue. Today we were helped by a white woman, middle aged, hair in ponytail. She had an attitude every time she spoke with either of us. I couldn’t understand why. Honest to god, no idea what her problem was. My brothers face was in very poor shape due to his accident this morning. His face was scraped and red all over with a broken nose and gash in his forehead. This guys clearly already having an awful day, why she seemed to have a bone to pick with him was beyond me. The last thing she did was throw the bag of medicine on the counter at him. It was the rudest part of the entire interaction. I was so appalled at that point. I couldn’t not react to her. I said, “have a great day!”. That’s all, but I said it with attitude. I simply couldn’t hold back my attitude anymore in response to hers. It was belligerent and intentional. Why, I haven’t got the slightest clue? But I feel that someone else who matters should be asking her what her problem is. Someone just got out of the hospital, is now out of work because of their accident, and has just had a really rough day and wants to go home, take their medication, and rest. He didn’t need her attitude as if he had done something wrong, offended, or mistreated her or anyone else. It was the most uncalled for attitude I’ve ever gotten from a cashier. I wouldn’t put her on the register if she doesn’t know how to respectfully interact with customers.Date of experience: September 28, 2022",1,Grocery

So they get the info & fill them I go to pick up & I wait while they fill the person's scripts in front of me. They don't move him to the side or anything, but Courtney DOES stand there & talk to him while I wait. Another women actually left because they told her to wait 10 minutes and she was still waiting after being there a long time..I finally get to the counter & I have to wait while they look for my scripts, now mind you they just filled them 20 minutes ago & they can't find them? Then I'm overcharged, even though I gave them the insurance info 2 days before. So COURTNEY tells me to step aside. I tell her I have food in the car, she tells me to go out & wait with my food. So I'm left standing there while they wait on others. So I got angry which after everything I've already delt with b/c of them I think I had every right and she tells me she doesn't get paid enough to deal with people like me. So I tell her again I have food in the car & I'm expected to get it home. (My family was waiting) and she tells me ""that's not my problem"".  I told her, all of this mess is YOUR problem! At that point the pharmacist finally came over & took care of the refund for me. I had only started going there because my scripts were cheaper BUT I immediately went to my old pharmacy & had them transfer my scripts back to them.

This store is convenient as it is on the way home from work. Today I used your online pick up service for the first and LAST time. I followed the instructions in the email I received and experience the worse customer service I have ever had. First, I walked into the (which was an option or curbside). I ""was"" going to purchase more items once I picked up my order which unfortunately didn't happen. I walked up the counter where the ""online pick up"" sign was (as instructed in the email). The young lady behind the counter was sitting down talking to someone and never acknowledged me. Then another customer came up to the counter, she went over and checked him out as well as 2 other customers that stepped up after. When I asked if I needed to be in another line for my pick up, she  laughed and said that I didn't need to come inside, they would have brought it out to me. She continued helping the other customers. When no one else was in line, she grabbed my order and pointed to the end of the counter without a word. As she was processing the order in the register she finally asked my name. After she completed my order and handed me the bag I asked to speak to the Manager on Duty. She proceeded to yell for someone named ""T"" and then told her a customer wanted to talked her. When the manager came from the back the girl never even directed her to me. I had to stop the manager from walking to the counter. After  telling her the issue, she did say she was sorry but I don’t feel anything will be done about this. So with all that said, I will be posting this on every media site I can because I work in retail and I would NEVER treat a customer like I was treated today.

RITE AID AND PROJECT BASELINE SHOULD LOSE THEIR GOVERNMENT CONTRACT TO DO COVID TESTING.  They don't send the results and they don't answer calls.  I've been trying for over an hour this morning to get results from Project Baseline, and I need the results TODAY because I need them in order to work.  I tested at the Rite Aid at 37399 Six Mile Road in Livonia on 12/9, and received no results.  The Reference ID# for my test on 12/9 is 8198324544, and I took the test at 10:30 on 12/9.    I have to have to Covid test results by today, 12/13, in order to work.  And when I called Rite Aid FIVE times this morning, at their customer service number 800-748-3243, starting at 8:27 a.m. (it's now 9:28 a.m.), all they say is that Project Baseline will be calling me within 10 minutes.  (I'm now on hold, and it's my fifth call to Rite Aid customer service.)  But all Baseline does is leave a message to request another call.  The phone does not ring, they only leave messages. I got Project Baseline's number from one of their messages and it's 805-637-7456, but when I call it, a pre-recorded message says to request a call back from Rite Aid, with no chance to talk to anybody!     One of the customer service agents at Rite Aid said to check if my phone was set on silent ring, but I checked, and it's not on Silent ring/do not disturb.  And I'm getting other phone calls from other people.  I went to settings, then to ""Sounds and Vibration,"" and ""Sound Mode"" is definitely turned ON.  The ""vibrate"" and ""mute"" settings are definitely turned off.     I'm sure Rite Aid and Project Baseline are collecting a lot of money from the government to do these ""free"" covid tests.

The young lady took the prescription and looked up the account and showed the on duty pharmacist to ensure they had the tablets. After discussing it with the pharmacist she brought the prescription back to me and said they could not fill it because the Vet had not written my address on it and they could not write it on there. All of the prescriptions I have had filled there never had the address written on them so I asked if something had changed from last month when the same exact prescription was filled at the same exact pharmacy. I was not upset and just asked the question, the pharmacist then came to the counter and started telling me that the DEA had strict rules on this medication, to which I asked her if the rules had changed from last month to which she rudely said if you would let me finish and stop jumping down my throat. I told her I was not jumping down her throat but was asking a question. I told her to please proceed and she again stated that the DEA had strict rules on the medication, I again told her I was not questioning the rules but asking if the rules had changed since last month to which she replied no. I then asked if they only enforced the rules sometimes since they had never done it before. She got upset and told me to leave and never come back. I was a little dumbfounded because I was just asking questions. I asked her for her name which she refused to give so I ten asked for the number to Coporate to which she replied I am sure you can figure it out yourself. This pharmacist who had a name tag with Lisa on it was very rude and unprofessional and I will never set foot in another Rite Aid for anything and have already transferred all prescription to Walgreens.On the way to drop the prescription off at Walgreens I did stop by my Vet and told him what just happened, he stated they never write addresses on prescriptions, he did so on mine to avoid any additional problems.Date of experience: January 20, 2023",1,Grocery

In 2018 I moved to Lancaster and my husband, and I went to the Rite Aid on Central Ave, in Lancaster.  We both had nothing but issues with them, Rx not filled in a timely manner or not at all.  Then we are asked to wait or come back, only to come back and they are still not filled. I signed up for TEXT alerts, which I had in Fairport and to this day have not received one from the Pharmacy telling me my script is done.  I have signed up 2x’s for this service with zero results.  IN 2018 my husband got fed up and went to Walgreens and has had no issues at all, he told me to go there but I really like the Rite Aid and was trying to be loyal to this one.  The Pharmacist is very rude, she is just too full of herself to help.  We have had insurance issues, my husbands company changed providers and we got new cards- I gave them the new card and thought they were using it.  I found out for over a year they were not using the right card and our Rx’s were no going through the correct insurance.  Apparently, they were using a coupon, which I was not even aware of. I went to pick up my Rx and ask for a copy of my Rx receipts because I was not seeing them on my plan.  She told me I did not have insurance, after an explosive minute, I gave her my card again. She then told me I would have to wait and come back the next day because she had to call my Dr to rewrite the script. Was she crazy I never heard of such a thing, I even questioned her thinking she meant insurance, but no she meant Dr. So, I paid reg price and told to make sure it was in the computer for next month. OMG guess what it was not there, my Rx was not ready, I told them I would be back at 9am to have it ready.  My husband was they’re at 9:15 and was told he would have to wait 20 minutes. I am guessing everyone in Lancaster is retired because the Pharmacist seems to think we have nothing to do but wait for them.

I said for a flu shot? She said ""It's our procedure"", We thought it was odd but now a days who knows maybe they have to add it to the COVID records. I was not happy and sent my Boyfriend to get them from the car. I said to her can I start to fill out the paperwork, she said NO she needed the card. Frankie came back in with the cards. We showed them to her. We filled out the paperwork and one spot asked why we were there, or something to that effect. I put Flu shot, Frankie didn't put anything in his. I said to the woman "" You look very flushed, she stated she was. I said I felt bad for her, she again stated she had done over 300 people and wasn't done for the day yet. At least I got her to smile. We were told to go sit and wait until we were called. After a while we were called in. I started to talk to the woman who was giving the shots. We talked for awhile and I said ok lets do the shot. I got mine first, all along thinking it was the flu shot. when Frankie got his and we were still talking. I have a very friendly personality and can easily talk to anyone. When she did the shot she said ""I almost hit the bone"". I said ""wow, good thing you didn't. She never gave Frankie back his paperwork and as we were leaving she was calling for Frank, I thought she meant the guy behind us. Frankie looked in the plastic box she was holding and said ""That's mine"", I said she gave you back your paperwork and the guy behind us was named Franklin. Again I thought it was him. Frankie said ""That's me, that's my license"". We kind of laughed about and left. After a couple hours Frankie's arm was killing him and he wasn't feeling good. I said ""Maybe because the way she gave you the shot almost hitting the bone"". That lasted for a few days. I have many health issues including muscle pain. From that day on it has gotten so much worse. I didn't think about it at the time. That following week we had to go see our Primary Doctor which was 1 week since we had gotten it. Our Doctor asked if we had gotten the flu shot we said we did. Not until 1 week later when we got home from the Doctor and Frankie was going to file his paperwork he looked and said ""Can you come here for a minute, I think they gave us the booster"". I said ""No they didn't it was the flu shot"".  When I looked at the paperwork Rite Aid gave both of us it stated it was the booster shot. Frankie called the store immediately we were told to come in, which we did. The Manager at that time came over and we told him the whole story. He printed out the paperwork we filled out. Mine stated Flu shot, and on Frankie's someone put in MDR or something like that. I was fuming and said to the Manger "" I wasn't sure if I even was going to get the booster shot. With my heath I wasn't going to take another shot then months from now they would come out with another one. Not only that the day we went only people 65 and older were getting the booster. I was 61 and Frankie was 64. They had no right to give us a shot that first we were not eligible for, second we weren't sure we wanted. The Manger was very kind and understanding. He said he was going to send our information to the main office and someone would get back to use either that day or the following day.To date December 6, 2021, we still have not heard a word.It's total outrageous, who gives them the right to give us a shot we didn't want?

I scheduled a COVID test at their drive in site and the web site and confirmation email said 1-3 days for results. AFTER waiting 15 minutes past my appointment and completing the test, they said 2-5 days. When I pointed out my confirmation said 1-3 days I was told they had no control over the lab. Well...that really isn't helpful. As everyone knows, in order to travel you need results for a sample within 72 hours or the test can't be used for travel. Rite Aid should be upfront about their inability to meet required timeframes so people have the opportunity to book with an organization that is more capable and accountable.Date of experience: July 14, 2021",1,Grocery

Susan Diamond,US,"Updated Jun 25, 2021","Don't come here for Covid testing.Although I'm generally a loyal Rite Aid customer, I wouldn't recommend using their services (through Project Baseline/ Verily) for a Covid-19 test, if you have other options.It's been seven days since we did a ""rapid"" test for our son. After waiting for several days with no results from Project Baseline, we decided to do another test directly with our son's medical provider (Kaiser), and received the results in less than 24 hours. Despite following up in all the recommended ways, we still haven't gotten results from Project Baseline.The difference between these two experiences is stark. It was very stressful and frustrating to wait so long for results from Project Baseline, given that we're a year into the pandemic and most facilities in LA seem to have streamlined their processes to be more efficient by now. In particular, we were disappointed by the lack of clarity around how the timeline for results would be impacted by the fact that the test was done on a Friday. In all the communications before and during his test, no mention was made of the fact that the expected turnaround time referred to business days only. It wasn't until several days later when we inquired about the delay that we received clarification that weekends were not included when calculating the expected turnaround time.Had we known this, we would have gone through Kaiser from the beginning. I realize and am grateful that we have access to Covid related resources that many others in the world do not. However, I offer this feedback to make other consumers aware and in the hope that Project Baseline/ Verily might improve their processes.Date of experience: June 24, 2021",1,Grocery

He actually said at one point that he was uncomfortable giving my daughter her second COVID shot. I think this was because he didn’t like the fact that I called the Rite-Aid customer service # to ask about the policy. He seemed to think my attempt to clarify and understand the policy was criticism of his character, which it wasn’t.

Could be an old stock. I returned it the next day. I told the lady, when I bought it the guy(cashier) asked me if I wanted the receipt, I trusted riteaid so I said No. I told her she could check my Riteaid card for proof and she said it doesn't work that way. The lady was not courteous, no smiles, no ""I'm sorry about that"". No customer service was what I felt. Take it or leave it was what I felt. She just said without a receipt i can only give you back the lowest price for that product in that month. I bought it for $15+ and only got back $7+. No way this product was sold for $7+ in the month of June. That is a big loss. If I would have lost a couple of bucks I would have been fine. But more than half of it is ridiculous considering next day return and never used. I even asked her to check the product but she said not necessary. I have never been asked if I wanted the receipt from any other establishments except for Riteaid and for a visa card print out. If your policy is to have a receipt to return goods then why tell/trained your staff to ask customers if they wanted a receipt or throw it out? Its already printed (was in his hands), just give it. Is it so that Riteaid can make money on customers like me if there's a return? First and last for me.

Between marketing decisions, the way they treat both employees and customers, and the business decisions they make, you'd little kids were calling the shots.  Instead of caring about quality service and making both customers and employees happy, they try to think up any possible thing to do to avoid addressing the issues.  They constantly make decisions only to reverse on them in a matter of days.  With just a elective business course in high school, I know that if you're making changes to a brand, you have to give some time to see the results, from a couple of months to a few years.  Yet the only decisions they stand by and double down on are ones that not only don't make sense from a business standpoint, but they just don't make sense at all.  This company is a sinking ship and will probably be gone within a decade unless they clean house completely at the top and middle, and bring in people that don't belong in a home for crazy people.Date of experience: November 13, 2020",1,Grocery

I was rudely awakened to find they ship the test across country to NJ and make you wait up to 10 days to get a result by email!  That is so long, it's irrelevant.

Kathleen,US,"Sep 12, 2020","Pharmacist Michelle, Santa Fe Square Encinitas CAI dropped off my prescription with MICHELLE at Santa Fe Center in Encinitas. It was a very busy day with a long line to pick up prescriptions. I needed to get my prescription that day and start the medication.Michelle told me the Encinitas store was out of the first choice for my RX but she did have the second choice. Then there was a problem with the way the RX was written by the doctor, so she  tried calling Shiley Eye Institute back because the incorrect amount was written on the prescription.(They wrote 1 and it should have been .1).The institute closed at 4:30 so she could not make contact. Then she took more time to find out what Rite Aid store would have the first medication that was preferred. She called two stores before finding one that actually had the correct medication on hand. MIchelle did all of this even though the line was growing longer and longer. She had only one assistant at the register ringing up and more than six people in line.I thanked her but feel she really went above and beyond in finding my medication. Please let her supervisors know that Michelle is a stellar employee and valued by  customers. From now on when I have a choice of where to fill my RX I am going to MIchelle because she really cares. It would have been much easier for her to tell me I had to wait until she could get it in stock. Then I would have had to scramble and call and drive all over to town to get my RX filledI was very impressed with her work ethic. MIchelle is  a very smart and caring pharmacist and we are lucky to have her working  at our Encinitas Rite Aid on Santa Fe Road in Encinitas.Thank you for finding a pharmacist that I can count on to help me out.Sincerely,Kathleen Nokes760 613 29161411 San Elijo AveCardiff, CA 92007Date of experience: September 12, 2020",5,Grocery

Today I'm there looking at the 75% discounted Easter candy and I pick up the bag of Lindor truffles which should be a good deal.  Then I see a big bag of Kit Kats so I grab those instead.  The manager walks by me as I get into line and picks up the Lindor chocolate, goes to the cashier and asks if he can do a price check on whether they're really 75% off.  The cashier confirms that they are and the manager says he's going to buy them himself.  I tell the manager I had  just picked those up but then took the kit cats.  Then he asks if I'm ready to check out so I walk up and say I hope these are 75% like they said.  He says they're not and I said then I'd like the ones I would have grabbed if I knew these weren't 75% off.  He said I'm buying those.  I said that I would have bought them if the other item wasn't incorrectly on the shelf.  He said that's too bad I'm buying them.  Maybe chalk this up to being bored from COVID-19, but I think a store manager should be mature enough and have at least a little sense of customers being correct, especially when they are.

Was told that it would be 5 to 7 business days before I would be refunded! BUT was also told that the ""refund"" would have to be reviewed and approved!  Rite Aid can hold the money forever because they ""might"" get the items in and when they do they can send them then.  REALLY?Items are not in stock, they lie to get you to order so they can keep your money indefinitely.What is happening to America?  There is no longer any accountability and these companies are getting away with fraud.Do not believe the good reviews - they are made up by Rite Aid administrators to fool consumers.Stay away from Rite Aid.Date of experience: March 16, 2020",1,Grocery

Jordan M Ehrlich,US,"Updated Feb 3, 2020","First and last Rite-Aid experience ever.I need a high-fiber diet; none of the stores around here were carrying fiber one anymore, so I ordered 9 boxes from riteaid to get free shipping 1 week ago, it said 3-5 days delivery.  Big mistake to rely upon them!  Order went through, but I checked on the order on Saturday and it still said Processing!  Tried to contact, but no one working on the weekend, OK.  Tried to leave a message, but contact form is so buggy that the only way to enter a message is to click submit and have the error handler put your cursor in the unclickable message box.  Then you try to click send but it says you have to select a message topic, but that is unclickable as well, from mobile or desktop, chrome and edge.  Over half of the support option buttons are missing, the one to contact the webmaster goes to a 404 page (very fitting).  Anyway, checked sunday, still processing, checked this morning, Monday a week after order, still processing.  Contacted support, they told me (after 10 minutes, ""sorry, your order has been canceled due to being out of stock.  Please re-order when it's in Stock""OK, why didn't the site notify me BEFORE I ORDERED that it was out of stock?  Or maybe after at some point?  Would it have stayed in Processing indefinitely??  How to even know when it's in Stock?  I asked if Rite-Aid could go ahead and expedite the order to me at no charge, I was told, ""Sorry, we only have Standard Shipping.  Plus we're out of stock""  Anyway, still had not received a refund, so I disputed the charge through credit card.  I should have received my fiber cereal in plenty of time before I ran out, but now I am out and out of luck.  Thankfully a local Target carries it; I would've thought a pharmacy would be more time-and-customer-conscious.

China Lake Blvd. Ridgecrest California 93555 giving basically thumbs up. I could not believe this being posted, as employee Susan Tunget was one of the employees featured in the picture. It is well known around Ridgecrest that this employee has been convicted on two counts of Welfare Fraud to Obtain Aid. This information can be found on The Kern County Superior Court website. If she had no problem committing fraud, are we to believe that she will not also steal from customers? Just because she is  sleeping/living with one of the stores shift supervisors, Douglas Sperry, is no reason she should have gotten employment here.

One month customer service for the coupon called for me and told them how to process it. The very next month, they again told me the coupon couldn’t be applied. I spent 30 minutes in the store asking Yunah the pharmacist to please just call the number on the coupon to find out how to process it.  I was treated so rudely by Yunah and Thea the cashier, I never picked up the prescription. Instead I had it transferred to a local, independent pharmacy. I couldn’t be happier.

So, if you get the bucket, don't try to scrape what's on the edge or catch the butter from dripping with your fingers and lick it off...you'll be alarmed by the terribly bitter, chemical you'll taste.I feel when it comes to products that are high quality, it should be no surprise that people also expect they're poured into clean containers with no toxic who knows what.Just very disappointing..Date of experience: July 23, 2022",3,Grocery

If your partner has their own jar you will violate your integrity by sneaking spoonfuls from it. Get at least a jar for every one in your houses and put your names on it. Wrap the lid on tape with your signature written on it to see if the seal is ever broken. Makes gift giving easy, give it to everyone. You can even ship it directly to them, which is good because you won’t be tempted to keep it for yourself.

They have few and all organic ingredients, and the jars/containers are good. Some are delicately sweetened, some a little more - could do with less, so that folks can add their own type and amount of sweetener to a preparation (say, maple instead of coconut) - so there is definitely room for improvement.

roxana,US,"Dec 18, 2024","Awful first experience followed by more…Awful first experience followed by more issues.  First, I placed an order for a type of yogurt that I can no longer find in my area.  The way the items were packaged allowed for the yogurt to move in transit and 2 of the 6 containers spilled all over the place.  Additionally, the order was received on Oct 11th and all containers had an expiration of Oct 16th, which is really not great.  So I contacted them via chat and I was told I should be hearing back from them within a business day.  This happened on Oct 11th, and by October 16th I had not heard back from them so then I emailed the whole chat transcript to their support group.  Meanwhile, I had discovered that I had 2 charges on my account for the same amount (close to $100/charge).  After much back and forth they gave me a credit for one of the charges and promised to undo the 2nd charge.  But did they?  No, I had to follow up again and they finally refunded the 2nd charge.On Dec 15th I decided it was time to use the store credit and be DONE with this company.  So I ordered the same darn yogurt but this time around the total exceeded the store credit by less than $1 so I had to add my credit card again.  I double and triple checked that the store credit will be applied and then placed the order.  I immediately saw an alert from my credit card that the charge was for the full amount so I reached out to the company and asked to have to store credit applied.  They responded fairly promptly that it didn't get applied when I placed the order and there is nothing they can do.  I immediately asked to have the order cancelled and here we are at the end of the 2nd business day since my reply I haven't heard back.  Just now I got a shipping notification.  So the saga will continue...My advice, stay away from this darn company.  I genuinely cannot wait to be done with them and their unscrupulous ways of doing business.

Order was shipped by them UPS and somehow delivered to the local United States Post Office.  The post office refused to return it so UPS could deliver it (no mail box at this rural location).  These guys said I had to contact UPS but when I did,  UPS said Food Service Direct was the shipper and I could not change it.  Instead of them simply taking charge and getting it fixed, they launched into blaming me and quoting their rules and regulations.  Then they started blasting me with their inability to do anything more because of Walmart policies.  So I escalated my issue direct to Walmart and they solved the issue in TWO minutes saying Food Service should have never treated me like they did and just handled it.   So after 14 days of back and forth I got credited by Walmart and they sent me a coupon for 25% my next purchase... which I will not use at Food Service Direct...  they suck.  🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 Then after acting like its all my problem... then they answer this review with baloney of 100% satisfaction.

I told the company I don't care about the monies send me another box of fresh crabs.. the company did not want to reimburse my monies or send me another box of fresh crabs.. I called the better Business bureau filled out a form and this is taking forever I paid $300.50. here it is March 2024.. and I'm still not able to get anything done. I've never had a company to treat me this way.. this is bad business. The company was not even concerned about me getting sick from the crabs. I'm still trying to find out what to do to get my $300.50 back. I don't know how often that this company do this to people but they will never have to worry about me buying anything from them again not ever.. the crabs came in the box a block of ice.. it took 3 days to thaw the ice in the refrigerator the only place to put them. I wasn't going to sit up and run hot water on the crabs trying to thaw.. that would have been a bad move. And the crabs were still on ice even after they thawed.. it's no way they can go bad even in the refrigerator still sitting in ice. you sold the crabs to me bad that simple. Stop trying to justify it just refund me my money you know you sold me bad crabs.. no way to treat customers after you receive moneys. Just to send me a bad product,. And the people in customer service know what's going on they're all liars.. I have pictures of black mold and big black holes in the crabs.  I just talked to Richard he said he saw the pictures . And there was nothing he could do for me bad company bad business. Do not deal with this company people if they did it to me they could do it to others. this is bad business they didn't even care about the fact that I got sick . It's also bad when a company can just rob you of your money and there's nothing you can do about it. Be careful out here people with your hard earned dollers. 😞Date of experience: September 27, 2023",1,Grocery

Shame on you,US,"Aug 19, 2023","I ordered Actual Veggie BurgersI ordered Actual Veggie Burgers. My absolute favorite food. I eat 2 a day so the actual veggie company told me that since I go through so many I could order from food service direct. I ordered 2 cases of the green burgers (80) burgers. When I received my item I opened the undamaged box , to find the top box was wet and the tape was barely attached, and the plastic dry ice bag had condensation and liquid dripping out. I lifted the box out and as i did the bottom fell out and the burgers fell to the ground. The second box i was very careful to remove so the same thing wouldnt happen. Again the tape was loose and it was wet as well. I called and explained to the rep what took place. She said I needed to send photos of the boxes , So I walked to the trash and removed the boxes and snapped photos. Thats all I was told was needed. I put the ones that fell in my normal trash bin. Two days later through email im told they need photos of the burgers. I state Im not digging through my trash , I should have been told that first. Basically they are just trying to get out of compensating me for poor packaging. I see by others reviews, thats their jam.

I was delighted when Bianca S. called me back! I explained my dilemma in needing an order for 50 people in three days for a church luncheon. She very calmly walked me through the shipping options. She even called her shipping department to make sure I would get them in time - going from one coast to the other! The order was processed on Monday morning (too late to get it in the day I called, Friday). It was shipped next-day air and I kept my fingers crossed. Lo and behold, my order arrived the next day, as promised. I was jumping for joy! We served the cabbage rolls at our luncheon and everyone LOVED them! I gave all the credit to Bianca in Virginia and soon everyone was praising Bianca in Virginia for getting this order to us on time for our luncheon. The cabbage rolls were large, sauce was great and they tasted excellent. The quality was above and beyond expectations having never had these rolls before.

These plates are unsuitable for putting on a dinner table.  I wish I could post a picture to show just how horrid they look.I have gone round and round with this company's ""customer service"" department.  They have offered no efforts at a resolution.  They keep telling me my satisfaction is important to them but, apparently, that's a lie as they will take no steps whatsoever to resolve this unfortunate situation.They've made it clear I'm stuck with these plates.  End of discussion. It's not their problem. Over $160 for plates that must go directly to the dump.Reading through some other reviews, I have lost count of how many times this company responds : ""Customer satisfaction is our top priority.""

Anonymous,US,"Oct 4, 2022","Misinformation Then Canceled OrderI am a former customer who had had some up-and-down experiences with FSD but was eager to give them another try because they list so many hard-to-find items on their website. On September 19 I received an email alert from FoodServiceDirect that my product was back in stock. I ordered it within half an hour. It was on special order so I expected a delay. After seeing the charge authorization drop from my credit card a week later, I contacted Food Service Direct customer service to confirm that the item would indeed be special ordered and fulfilled. I was told that yes, it would, and it would arrive by October 14, and I would receive a tracking number when it shipped. I was so happy.Yesterday I noticed the price of the item increased by about $15 on the website, so I was glad I already had my order in. Today I received a notice saying that due to supply chain issues, the order was canceled. It is now listed as Out of Stock again on website, at the higher price point. If it wasn't available to special order I should never have received a back-in-stock notice, and upon checking with customer service to see if it would be fulfilled I should have been told it might not be fulfilled. I am super disappointed because I don't have the luxury of enough of a credit card balance for trial-and-error ordering this way.

Dave,US,"Sep 20, 2022","Very disillusioned with this companyVery disillusioned with this company. By looking on the website items are listed as in stock or waiting processing. This leads a prudent person to believe that these items are warehoused or expected to be delivered to their facilities. In truth this is a drop ship company no products are warehoused for shipping. So I’m my case they sent an email that my product I had been waiting to be stocked for some time was in stock and encouraged me to order before their supplies were exhausted. I ordered immediately waited weeks just to be emailed that due to “ supply chain issues” my order wouldn’t be filled and my money refunded. At no point did they attempt to minimize this absolute failure nor research and give me a date they could in fact fill my order. I’ll look for alternate sources going forward.

This company has done everything they can to help, by no means do my below comments reflect on them or their product only their choice to use evri…please consider changing your choice of delivery company, that’s all I ask.Im willing to change this 1 star to a 5 star after being contacted. Poor delivery due to using evri to deliver. Using this as a way to influence their decisions over using poor delivery services as that's the only way evri will get the message. The driver ladled the item as delivery attempted while i was sat 3 meters away from the door at 7:44pm tonight... it didn't get knocked, and i have a lit up working doorbell that didn't get pressed. So now my cheese slices are sat on my evri drivers floor or in his car, because he couldn't be bothered to deliver it, and ill have to now wait 2-3 days for his wife to drop it down when she has some free time.

Walter Evan Bircher,US,"Jan 14, 2024Verified","Pros and ConsHave not tried the taco shells yet, but I am anxious to do so.The chips have the thickness and consistency of the fried flour tortilla chips in a Mexican food restaurant. But, they do not have much flavor. However, due to their thickness, I was able to use a keto cowboy cracker recipe to jazz them up a bit. I would buy them again just for that.The tortillas are tiny. Like street taco size. So, I probably will not purchase them again, as I prefer the larger tortillas.The packaging was very good and shipping was decent. I will buy the chips again (because of their consistency).Tnx.Date of experience: December 25, 2023",4,Grocery

Jonathan Nelly,US,"Updated Mar 18, 2024Verified","First timerUPDATED 3/15/2024: Updating my rating to 5-stars based on Mr. Tortilla's customer service. The quality of their products are already top notch, but add excellent customer service and that elevates their overall rating in my opinion.First time trying Mr. Tortilla, and based on my first experience, I will try them again.I ordered the Taco Time bundle of assorted tortillas and hard taco shells, plus the Crispy Chips Bulk Bag of the Black Truffle Sea Salt. The order came well packaged, but unfortunately, one of the 4 bags of hard taco shells came broken. I couldn't use them for tacos, so I ate them as chips.As with any low carb tortillas or chips, they have that dry consistency to them, but not as bad as other low carb options out there. I like the variety they have and the flavors really come out in their tortillas. Since the tortillas aren't made with the usual flour, I don't recommend heating them up on a pan or directly on fire as they are thin and will get hard. I found that microwaving them kept the tortillas soft. The Black Truffle Sea Salt chips were also good. Again, not as dry as other low carb chips on the market. They are also hard enough to eat with a dip.Had to knock off one star due to a bag of the hard taco shells being broken, but overall, I really enjoy Mr. Tortilla products and will purchase more of their products.Date of experience: January 24, 2024",5,Grocery

Carlos,US,"Dec 24, 2024","Shorted on my order then told leaving a bad review is ""threatening him"" when I was scammed almost a half Gram of HashishI was in communication with a rep of the company Kyle and mentioned a small flower and concetrate sampler pack I offered too pay extra for so I'd have a better idea of what I'd want for bulk come after the new years since shipping is halted due too holidays.Well instead of replying he just never sent them which honestly wasn't the issue just when a representative says they'd include samplers I was curious why they didn't stick too there word.When my ""gram"" of afghan hashish arrived it was just the has in a box with a note for law enforcement, not even vacuum sealed or bubble wrapped. Worst shipping I've seen for any product so I'd hope it's better for other products but the hash does smell.When expressing my concerns I also explained I'm stressed this past month as ive had too take my mother and spend a noght with her in the ER and then had too take my cat in for surgery later the next day and didn't wanna leave a negative review without trying too get into contact with customer service and was gonna wait too dispute or leave any review until January or so since shipping halted anyways and I figured it'd give is time too properly discuss what happened and give me a few chances too weigh. Well I made the mistake of not zeroing out the tray I used for the hash on my MG scale and he assumed the tray + hash = 1006mg was on weight and basically told me I'm wrong, I was threatening him by saying ""I'd rather figure this out between us then leave slander when the company doesn't deserve it since I know how chaotic the holidays are"" so yeah, the rep ""Kyle"" got weirdly defensive and started playing the victim when my hashish is short anywhere between 0.1-0.4 I was gonna buy another scale and weigh it but it doesn't oay when the vendor refused too conduct themselves properly and simply acted childish over email in which I will be sharing publicly. He took me saying that i don't wanna leave a negative review but will as threat which is the most insane defensive excuse I've ever heard. It's easier for Kyle too play victim rather than take accountability.I even made it clear in my email I didn't want anything extra just wanted the difference if what I was shorted or a discount/what I'm owed included in my next order. Instead he wanted too assume he knew my scale and be very dismissive, childish and unprofessional. Take this as a warning I've soend well over $600 through these guys as my first few buys the shake quality was amazing for pre rolls but the second I bought actual nugs for the flower when I got a batch that looked way darker, way less frosty and tasted bad that had budrot!! This isn't my first bad experience with them but last time I bought so much flower each so was overweight which made up for things since I turned it into edibles amd got a steal. Hashish on the other hand I paid out the Yingyang for and didn't even get a full gram. Be warned!! They might be legit for a little while but thats how they get you. The second you get anything wrong with your package they become a victim and refuse too take responsibility as the vendor which is just jaw dropping. I see why the THCA subreddits give the owners of BlackTieCBD alot of shit for being reselling scam artistsHell even tye second time I bought shake the quality was way worse amd that should've been my first red flag plus all the negative reddit post and pictures of budrot in there flowerSave yourself the stress and work with someone who cares about there customers unless you dont mind moldy flower/budrot, being shorted and being taken advantage of until you have an issue then they tell you shop else where. Willing too share my emails too prove I never said anything threatening and pretty much said I need the rest if the gram I'm owed as I paid for it and rightfully should be allowed to have a full Gram.It's fine as his reply and this whole situation will make for quite the post on forums.Thanks for saving me money Kyle c; and too think I seriously considered giving BlackTieCBD a second chance on a personal bulk order. Shame on you guys, you know what your doing and play ignorance. Quite sad in all honesty, Kyle and the BlackTieCBD team are what's wrong with this industry and will be what gets this industry heavily regulated like normal THCThis has been an all night ordeal, once I get some rest I'll weigh it on multiple MG scales and provide pictures as mine says I'm short .4g which is more accurate than my big scale which could only get a rough estimate for a gram under.Really disappointed Kyke conducted himself the way he did but it explains the nearly hundreds if other bad experiences others have had across platforms like fb and reddit. 99% of people say shop with Arete, PHC, VG, G Extracts etc pretty much anyone other than BlackTieCBD.

So right after that phone call I tried 2 still nothing, I don't smoke weed I don't even smoke CBD so I have a very low tolerance to it. Night before last I ate 5 still nothing.

Eric,US,"Jan 24, 2022Verified","Realized it's been 4 years with Black tie...After using Black Tie CBD for a few dozen or so items over 4 years  and comparing to a few others I guess I can write a review now, although I might have reviewed the pops already. Overall very happy with the quality I get from Black Tie and their prices and shipping are decent  in my eyes as well. They are not the absolute cheapest around but you don't wanna cheap-out on CBD I don't think and they are actually pretty good by comparison and far from the priciest and you do get what you pay for with Black Tie.  I wish industry wide prices were cheaper, but thats another review. Was not a fan of the Squib gummies but they changed brands so now I am  digging the Enjoy brand gummies. My other favorites on repeat are the swirl pops, gum, tinctures, and Isolate.  My only complaint would be the tincture doesn't come in a clear bottle so you can't see how much is left, Otherwise A+ . My one customer service experience was good and the shipping is prompt enough and packaged well each time and if your on the mailing list you can take advantage of the occasional special. Lastly, just my opinion as someone who seems to get a pretty good benefit from CBD/CBG but struggles with medications through my health care provider, prices industry wide need to come down and more medical research needs to be done and laws changed or whatever so practicing doctors can begin prescribing CBD  and related medications. /minirant over :)   Thanks Black Tie , I'll keep coming back when I can afford it .Date of experience: January 24, 2022",4,Grocery

Unhappy and wasted a lot of my,US,"Updated Nov 7, 2021Verified","Switch Prices from the list price to a higher price at checkout, WATCH for This!Their website is messed up.  It shows one price then when I go to check out it gave me a coupon and raised the original price!  It ended up being more than what is was listed for.  And the owner told me I did not know how to work a computer.  What a scumbag!   And he would not honor the listed price!  This is about as bad as it gets.  This looks like deception.  They list one price then in the cart it is a higher price.  They have a poor website and the owner says it is my fault cuz I do not know how to use a computer.  How can 2 different prices be my fault.  They raise the price at the checkout if you try to use a certain higher discount code!  The owner had a chance to do the right thing and he WOULD NOT.  I even told him I was going to post negative reviews cuz it was flat out wrong and I did not want it to happen to anyone else and he still refused to make it right.  That ought to tell you something, if he does not care about his business I don't think he would care about my little purchase.After getting a reply to this they told me they looked into the matter and could not find a mistake or issue.  But I sent them a screen shot of the different price when I went to checkout than what the list price is.  When I first contacted them, so they have undeniable evidence.  These people are so incompetent it is beyond mind boggling.  They have the screen shot of a cheaper price and directly on their site is another price.  This is such bogus crap!!!I can't stand dealing with people like this.  And they have the nerve to say I don't know how to work a computer.  BlackTie you guys are the biggest joke of a company than I have seen my entire life.  Mind boggling ignorance and they claim they can't find the issue but I sent them screenshot of the problem.

JJ,US,"Updated Jul 30, 2024","DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING-SCAMMERSDO NOT ORDER ANYTHING! DISGUSTING SCAMMERS-Health Central USA Terrible-My order was refunded (SO THEY SAY...I HAVE NOT RECEIVED A REFUND) without my knowledge (no call no email prior to my inquiry for status on delivery) that they say was because ""...you (I) chose delivery out of the local delivery area"" and it ""created an issue in their system."" They did not give me notice until I waited the 14-28 days for delivery (as per their instructions) and then inquired on the status. The following was sent to me in their email: ""I am sorry to hear that. I researched your issue. If you check your order confirmation email, it looks like you chose the local delivery option. Because you live outside the local delivery area it created an issue in the system. Don't worry! I just pulled your order from the que and the system canceled your order and issued a full refund to you. Refunds typically take 3 to 6 days to go through depending on how fast your bank processes their transactions."" This was sent 3 minutes after they sent me the email stating they refunded my purchase. With the ""system"" error wouldn't you think that within 28 days there would be some kind of alert about an order? I can guarantee there was no ""issue in the system"" when they received the $98.48 from my bank...no system disrupts there?I was emailing back & forth with “JJ” and asking to place a new order (several times-to no avail-he didn’t even acknowledge that I was trying to place a new order-he kept telling me about my refund) and was told “We stop taking order!” These people are a disgusting waste of human life.Also BEWARE OF Remedy Health MediaWho owns Health Central?In 2011, HealthCentral was acquired by Remedy Health Media, a digital health information and technology provider.

I thought so, too, for a while, but it isn't.When you place an order, be clear if you are signing up for local pickup in the Dallas area. I did this without realizing it and expecting it to be delivered, so there was some confusion. It turns out in the end that the product was out of stock at the manufacturer anyway.Emails were not returned when trying to contact someone about what happened to my order, and the phone number listed on their Facebook page didn't work. This is when I began to think that I had been scammed.Eventually, however, someone contacted me, and a full refund was issued.As with any online retailer I'm unfamiliar with, I should've first seen if I could contact their customer service department before placing an order.
