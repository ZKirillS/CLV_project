The formula includes vitamin B12 which contributes to normal energy-yielding metabolism, vitamin C to maintain the normal function of the immune system, and vitamin D to help maintain normal healthy teeth and bones.

,"Centrum","Vitamins, Minerals & Supplements › Combination Multivitamins & Minerals","Product DescriptionWomen have different nutritional needs to men. That's why Centrum has used its expertise to develop Centrum Women multivitamins for women that are specifically designed to help support the nutritional needs of women. This tailored blend of multivitamins for the specific needs of women contain vitamins B6 and B12 + iron to contribute to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue. Vitamin C supports the normal function of the immune system while biotin and zinc help to maintain normal hair, and skin. These multivitamins also contain selenium to help maintain nail health and vitamin D and calcium to help maintain strong bones. Packaging and tablet colour may vary slightly. You may have noticed that the way our Centrum tablets look has changed. This is because we have replaced one of the components we use to colour the tablet called the ‘opacifier’, from titanium dioxide to calcium carbonate. This change in appearance in no way impacts the quality, effectiveness or stability of Centrum, it’s the same high-quality product that Centrum is known for. *Based on worldwide sales of the Centrum range.

That's why Centrum Advance formula has been developed by experts to provide a high-quality supplement to help support all your nutritional needs and support your everyday health and wellbeing. Vitamins B2 and B6 help to unlock energy from food and contribute to your overall health and wellbeing while vitamin C supports the normal function of the immune system. Vitamin B6 also contributes to normal protein and glycogen metabolism. These multivitamins also contain calcium, which contributes to the normal function of digestive enzymes and vitamin A which supports the maintenance of normal vision. Packaging and tablet colour may vary slightly. You may have noticed that the way our Centrum tablets look has changed. This is because we have replaced one of the components we use to colour the tablet called the ‘opacifier’, from titanium dioxide to calcium carbonate.

,"Centrum","Vitamins, Minerals & Supplements › Vitamins › Multivitamins","Product DescriptionYour body requires a certain amount of vitamins and minerals every day to function. That's why Centrum Advance formula has been developed by experts to provide a high-quality supplement to help support all your nutritional needs and support your everyday health and wellbeing. Vitamins B2 and B6 help to unlock energy from food and contribute to your overall health and wellbeing while vitamin C supports the normal function of the immune system. Vitamin B6 also contributes to normal protein and glycogen metabolism. These multivitamins also contain calcium, which contributes to the normal function of digestive enzymes and vitamin A which supports the maintenance of normal vision. Packaging and tablet colour may vary slightly. You may have noticed that the way our Centrum tablets look has changed. This is because we have replaced one of the components we use to colour the tablet called the ‘opacifier’, from titanium dioxide to calcium carbonate. This change in appearance in no way impacts the quality, effectiveness or stability of Centrum, it’s the same high-quality product that Centrum is known for. *Based on worldwide sales of the Centrum range.

,"Wellkid","Vitamins, Minerals & Supplements › Vitamins › Multivitamins","Product DescriptionExpert nutritional support for kids Wellkid Multi-vitamin Liquid provides a comprehensive range of vitamins and minerals, plus malt extract which is specially formulated to help safeguard the nutritional intake of children aged 4-12 years. Comprehensive supplement for kids Wellkid Multi-vitamin Liquid has been produced with children's specific needs in mind to provide a comprehensive range of 15 nutrients, plus Swiss Alpine malt to help safeguard your child's nutritional intake. It comes in a great tasting natural orange flavour that kids will love. The challenges of healthy eating Growth is especially rapid during the first 12 years of a child's life. Continuous development of bones, muscles, blood and the brain mean that children have a high nutrient requirement compared to their body size. Meeting those nutritional requirements can be a challenge, as it is common for children to be fussy eaters. You may experience your child refusing to eat certain foods, disliking certain tastes or textures, or being reluctant to try new foods. Children usually grow out of fussy eating and in the meantime nutritional supplements such as Wellkid Multi-vitamin Liquid can help safeguard a child's nutritional intake as part of a balanced diet. Government surveys have indicated that children's diets can be low in certain nutrients such as iron, which contributes to normal cognitive development of children. This is especially true for vegetarians, as iron from non-meat sources may not be as easily absorbed by the body. Wellkid Multi-vitamin Liquid is formulated with moderate levels of iron and is suitable for vegetarians. Support for rapid development Wellkid Multi-vitamin Liquid is formulated with iodine which contributes to normal growth in children, plus vitamin D which helps maintain normal growth and development of bone in children. The UK Department of Health recommends young children aged up to 5 years take a daily supplement containing vitamin D. The vitamin D in Wellkid Multi-vitamin Liquid is included in the preferred vitamin D3 form (cholecalciferol) that is naturally produced by the skin when exposed to direct sunlight. Calcium is an essential mineral, also needed for normal growth and development of bone in children. However, it has not been included in the Wellkid Multi-vitamin Liquid formula, as it is not possible to include a meaningful amount in the multi-vitamin formula. For mothers particularly concerned about the normal bone health of their children we recommend Wellkid Calcium Liquid, which contains calcium and vitamin D and can be taken alongside Wellkid Multi-vitamin Liquid.IngredientsIngredients: Purified Water, Raw Cane Sugar, Malt Extract (from Barley), Glucose Liquid (Sulphur Dioxide), Ferric Ammonium Citrate, Zinc Sulphate, Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid), Stabiliser: Xanthan Gum, Niacin (as Nicotinamide), Preservative: Potassium Sorbate, Natural Flavouring (Orange Oil Extract), Vitamin E (DL-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate), Acidity Regulators: Citric Acid & Sodium Hydroxide, Pantothenic Acid (D-Panthenol), Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin 5-Phosphate Sodium), Thiamin (Vitamin B1 as Hydrochloride), Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine HCl), Copper Sulphate, Vitamin A (as Palmitate [Antioxidant: DL-Alpha Tocopherol]), Folic Acid (as Pteroylmonoglutamic Acid), Potassium Iodide, Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol), Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin). p> Allergy Advice: For allergens, see ingredients in bold.DirectionsSHAKE WELL BEFORE USE.

,"SOLGAR","Vitamins, Minerals & Supplements › Combination Multivitamins & Minerals","Product Description ""  Solgar VM-PRIME for Women is an advanced multivitamin designed to provide nutrient levels that meet or exceed nutritional requirements for women over 50. For example, increased levels of vitamin B-12, Manganese, Zinc, Selenium, Chromium, Copper and Molybdenum.  Fifty can be fabulous. Each stage of life (infancy, adolescence, adulthood and senescence) has unique nutritional requirements. Young and adult populations up to the fourth decade of life require nutrients to support growth, such as the “building” of body tissues. By contrast, middle age and upwards is characterized by a decline in statute, loss of skeletal and muscle tissue, decreased nutrient intake and increased susceptibility to chronic disease. Therefore, it is recommended that people over the age of 50, in addition to a healthy and well-balanced diet, take a quality multivitamin. VM-PRIME for Women is designed to provide optimum nutrition for women seeking to maintain adequate nutrient intake and prevent the onset or progression of disease.  In addition, the two-a-day dosage of VM-PRIME for Women has been made smaller than average multivitamin tablets, making them easier-to-swallow.
