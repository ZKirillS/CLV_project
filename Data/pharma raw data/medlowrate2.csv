Ben Noll,GB,41 minutes ago,"Sadly failed to deliver. Sadly, after providing only one of the two retainers I have had to give up and request a charge back as customer service have ghosted me. Originally I had made the order and got the impression kit almost instantly. However after being given the go ahead to send them back. I was informed of a problem with the impressions. So I had to pay to get another kit. Slightly bothered as we threw away a ""spare"" impression which we could have used if this was raised at the time the original email was sent. Then once this had been sent back, I received only the one of the pair. The ""newest"" impression. After the previous one had been put on hold to wait. Customer service then told me I would need another impression kit and after a few attempts at giving me a code. I had a kit ordered. Since returning this impression set I have not heard from them. upon chasing it up they claim that it was sent back with the ""original"". After explaining the situation to the customer service agent I have not got a reply within 7 days. So I am writing this review and will be requesting a charge back.

Odri Stain,YE,"Dec 17, 2024","Good Results!I had a fantastic experience with Retainers Direct! From the moment I reached out, the team was incredibly helpful and professional. The process of ordering my retainers was smooth and easy, with clear instructions every step of the way. My retainers fit perfectly, and the quality is top-notch. What impressed me most was the attention to detail and the fast delivery. I’ve been using them for a while now, and I couldn’t be happier with the results. Highly recommend Retainers Direct for anyone in need of reliable and high-quality dental retainers!Date of experience: December 10, 2024",5

Calista Hett,US,"Nov 12, 2024","Great retainers, long wait timeThe retainers are well made and fit well, and compared to the $600 my ortho wanted it was a steal! My 4 out of 5 is due to the long wait time for them to arrive - I was told it would take about 10 days from when they received the impressions, and it ended up taking over 6 weeks. When I did check in on status they were always quick to reply with a time frame, the time frame was just wrong multiple times. So fair warning, order EARLY and you'll be just fine!Date of experience: September 30, 2024",4
Mitchell Miya,US,"Oct 7, 2024","Excellent customer serviceI ordered from retainers direct in 2022. It took two attempts to get my mold correct, but the process was fairly easy and quick.

Sent pictures for approval Received a quick response, and impressions were sent back very next day. Received confirmation impressions were received on August 16th, Retainers were shipped out August 19th received August 26th so the turn around time was great roughly two weeks.

Natasha Quinn,US,"Jun 20, 2024","Retainers direct sounded too good to be…Retainers direct sounded too good to be true. It took them a very, very long time (about three-four months) for the whole process and they never even reached out about it. Every time I wanted an update I had to ask myself. When I finally did get them, the notes said that both the top and bottom retainer were “sloppy and hard to fit” when I followed their directions exactly for the molding. They did end up fitting well, but the top was very tight and incredibly difficult to get off at first. Overall, these retainers are useful and way cheaper than a standard orthodontist would charge, but the experience wasn’t the best. Date of experience: June 07, 2024",3

But customer service was always nice, apologizing for the delay, letting me know the reasons behind it, and reassuring me that my retainers were still in the queue to production.

Listen, they have great response and shipping time, their website is build for quick sales… it’s all well run company but their product is trash. I ordered my retainer less than a year ago and it’s already cracked twice. I thought it was off that they have a subscription for retainers on their website but now I know why. They only last a few months. They said it’s made w the same product as the orthodontic retainer but that is simply not true, or maybe it’s the same product but certainly not the same quality.

I ordered an impression kit which was relatively easy to use with the instruction provided, I would’ve preferred a scan like I had with a previous company that went out of business. The process did take longer than expected but I was able to speak to someone on the phone who gave me a pretty accurate timeframe. I was patient and received a great set of retainers that fit and feel great. Only thing I would’ve liked was a bit more communication from them.

Ben Bodenmiller,US,"May 19, 2024","Slow & misleadingShipped kit quickly however they were very slow getting retainer back. The review scores on their site and Facebook are a lie & not based on live data but rather are just a picture of a 5 star.The kit needs better instructions - the putty hardens very fast and they only give you one tray. They should give multiple trays & more putty so you can take multiple impressions & select the best. Additionally they adverse a case being included but that is not true. Upon asking they said they no longer provide that - yet it's still part of the advertised kit.If you need more putty it costs a bunch whereas there competition (sportingsmiles) mails it to you complimentary, knowing you aren't wanting to use more putty but messed up and need to.Overall do not recommend, use the competition like ssportingsmiles or clearretain.Date of experience: March 15, 2024",3

They also sent me a mold of my teeth to use any time I need a new retainer. The retainers are great quality and more clear than the originals I received from the orthodontist. I love them! The customer service is a little slow but that didn’t affect the timing of my delivery or the quality of my retainers. I will definitely will be using RetainersDirect again for a replacement!

Jedediah Russell,US,"Aug 5, 2024","Likely wasted $150You pay $150 for four attempts to get your upper and lower impressions correct with instructions to send photos to a company email where they provide feedback to how well they did your impression.I got the first impression on the first try. I then wasted the other three pairs of putty trying to get the upper impressions right. Each time I got an identical, canned, vague response indicating there were 'distortions' on the 'front area' of my impression with instructions to watch the videos (which we had already done. Religiously).Now we're left with (a) paying $15 to get two more sets of putty with no guarantee that those will turn out any different or (b) sending in the best-looking impression we've tried and hoping that they work in spite of the email feedback.Their refund policy doesn't apply once you mix even one of the sets of putty, so you're really locked in.In summary, customers need to know that they are paying less money not because they're getting some sort of deal, but because the their business model depends on a certain percentage of people's impressions to not work out and for them to give up and not send impressions in.

It was also very easy to communicate with the team at Retainers Direct when I needed to. Overall I had a great experience and will definitely use them in the future.Date of experience: November 01, 2023",5
Dan,US,"May 7, 2024","They strung me along for eight weeks and the retainer doesn’t fit because of random alterationsIt took two long months, eight weeks, to receive the retainers. Every week I emailed asking for the status, and every week I get an automated reply claiming that my order is in the final stages of production and would be shipped out in a few days. I have email after email, going back weeks, stating the exact same thing from their automated customer service. I finally received the retainer and along with a note saying that the mold lacked detail and had distortions. For eight weeks I waited and not a single person contacted me to tell me this. Instead of contacting me directly and being honest about the timeline and the problem, they made random alterations. The retainer does not fit my teeth and causes severe pain. When I asked for my money back, they asked for photos, without giving me a solution nor a timeline of how long a replacement will take. I have no confidence in this company and their lack of care for their customers. A replacement would likely take weeks and weeks if not months like the original retainer order. Who is going to pay for the damages to my teeth in the meantime? I have filed a complaint with a Better Business Bureau and with the FTC because of their dishonest business practices. If I don’t get a satisfactory resolution in a timely manner, I will be seeking damages.Date of experience: May 06, 2024",1
Caitlin Anderson,US,"May 10, 2024","Waste of time.If you have the opportunity to go anywhere else - do so. I sent my impressions on February 15 (they received them on the 20th). I JUST called (may 6th) and had to cancel my order because they still weren’t shipped. I was strung on for multiple weeks through emails that said “we think they will be shipped this week”. I worked with Tanner in customer service over email and I told him to please call me and he said “I tried calling but you didn’t answer” but I know for a fact he didn’t call me. I had to call multiple times in order to get someone to pick up the phone so I could get a refund. And when they say “full refund” it’s not true. I paid $91 total and only got $74 back due to their “fees”. Overall it was a terrible experience and waste of my time.

Madison Kay Sanderson,US,"Jun 28, 2024","Would recommendDoing the impression mold was fairly easy to follow with the online instructions, I would recommend thoroughly going through the instructions ahead of time because my first impression putty set too quickly as I was reading before I could bite into it. Fortunately, they provide a total of 3 putty sets so I was able to redo it with no issues on the 2nd try. Mailing the impression out was super easy, my only complaint was that it took about 2 months from when I dropped the package at the post office to receiving the retainer and I thought it may have gotten lost in the mail. A notification that the impression has been received and the ability to track the retainer shipment would be a great addition. However, upon receiving my retainer, it fit perfectly! It actually fit so perfectly that I thought it was stuck after the first insertion, but starting from the molars I was able to ease it off and after a few nights it loosened just a tad to come on and off easier. I would definitely recommend versus an in-person visit with the orthodontist!Date of experience: April 30, 2024",4

Zoë Hardman,GB,"Nov 13, 2023","Poor comms, poor productThere are several aspects that have made this a disappointing experience. The information on the website on how to take the impressions is contradictory to the instructions in the box in terms of when and how to send the impressions back to them. I also had to pay extra for postage, despite being in the free-return window because the box was slightly bigger once the impressions were in it.The end result is poor quality. The retainers barely cover the teeth, so they’re unlikely to offer the support needed. When I complained about these things, the communication has been dismal. I’ve had to chase several times, ultimately taking weeks to get any sort of “final answer”. That final answer basically being ‘deal with it’.I get the feeling this is a small business being run on the side of a busy dental practice, which is no bad thing but clearly they don’t have the time or resource to manage both businesses and should focus on one. All in all, my advice is to go to your orthodontist and pay the extra.Date of experience: November 13, 2023",1
Meredith Whitley,US,"Jul 17, 2024","These retainers are a jokeThese retainers are a joke. I guess this is what I get for wanting to save some money. It all started out fine. I paid my money and received the impression kit shortly after that. We completed the impressions following the instructions and sent photos of the impressions to get them approved before sending them back. We received approval of the impressions and sent them in to have the retainers made. The time it took to get the “retainers” back was a bit ridiculous, and to my surprise when we opened the package there was a post card that was filled out with boxes checked that said things like “your upper impression was shallow did not capture all the teeth or the gumline” and “your upper impression had some distortion and lacked detail” The same comments were made for the lower impressions. Then there was a handwritten part of the postcard that said “Lower last molars not included.” Are you kidding me? Why on earth would you have made the retainers if the impressions were not good enough and didn't even include ALL OF THE TEETH?? Why would you have “approved” these impressions? This is absolutely mindboggling to me that you would deliver a subpar product and include a note basically saying “the impressions were no good, so here’s some crappy retainers”?

Michael Brown,US,"Jul 11, 2024","retainers made with inferior materialsI ordered my retainers after taking the molds of my teeth and it took a long time with very little communication about the timing.  I had to badger the company several times as it was more than double the estimated time to make the retainers.  Then, inside of 30 days, the top retainer cracked.  They replaced it at no cost which was fine.  I was hoping that was a one off as in the past when I had retainers they did not crack.  These seem to be of thinner material.  I had purchased the multi-year replacement program and figured this would be good.  Recently, now about 3-4 months later the bottom retainer cracked.  They said it was possibly because i may clench or grind my teeth which may be true - I am not sure, but these should be thick enough to withstand what is normal activity.  When I asked about the cracked bottom retainer, they asked for photos which they had one as well on the first round.  I sent them and they offered to replace it with a $49 charge.  Frankly, I thought that was my discounted price anyhow under the 3-year program which I paid extra for.  Now, they also want me to send back my molds to make the new retainers.  This does not make sense as I did not have to do this when they replaced by cracked upper retainer.  This process is complicated and I am not very pleased.  I think they should be able to send these more quickly and with less hassle and not crack so easily.  They should last with normal use for at the very least - one full year.  I am only part of their program as SmileDirect went under so this is overall a disappointing experience.  Of course, Retainers Direct had nothing to do with Smile Direct so this is not reflective of that component.  Date of experience: July 11, 2024",2
Matt Baumann,US,"Dec 13, 2023","If Time is of the Essence, Look ElsewhereI had Invisalign orthodontic work done several years ago and only wear my retainers at night to keep them in place. The set I was originally given was getting gross and cracked so I decided to try Retainers Direct to get a fresh set.The in-home impression kit was straight forward enough. I sent those in and they confirmed they were received via email on 11/9. On 11/11 I received an email stating they were working on the retainers, and that typical turnaround time was 7-10 days. Sounded reasonable to me.12/1 came and I still had not received the retainers, nor any updates from the company, so I reached out. Received an email back stating that they apologized for the delay, and that my retainers should be sent out that week. Frustrating, but fine at least I'd be getting them soon.It is now 12/13. I have received no further updates. I still do not have my retainers. At this point I'm wondering if I'll be getting them at all. Do not tell your customers the turnaround is 7-10 days when it has now been well over a month without receiving them. I'm not usually one to complain about companies, but when it comes to retainers customers need them quickly to avoid further shifting of teeth. Thankfully my existing pair are still holding up. If I don't wear them for 2 nights in a row my teeth already begin shifting. Frankly this is just unacceptable from Retainers Direct.Not to mention, they are misrepresenting their Trust Pilot rating on their website as being 5 stars. That's clearly not the case, so on top of having poor service, they are just flat out lying to you. Look elsewhere for retainers.Date of experience: December 12, 2023",1

Miry Russell,US,"Updated Dec 7, 2024","Difficult Process, Received Refund3rd Update- They have issued me a refund which I appreciate and feel is a fair response to the ill-fitting retainer. I will be seeing an orthodontist to get a replacement retainer. 2nd Update- They changed their minds and will not be giving me a refund because it's been 60 days from the date of purchase. That is a terrible policy given that how long the process takes is not solely dependent on you as the customer.Update- I have been offered a refund for the lower retainer which I appreciate and feel is an appropriate response. I have chosen to update my review from 2 stars to 4. Upper Impression and Retainer  I chose Retainers Direct as a more affordable alternative to purchasing retainers from an orthodontist. Their videos and instructions for creating dental impressions at home with putty and a tray appeared simple enough.  Initially, I had issues with my upper impression. After submitting pictures via email for review, my upper impression was rejected. I had to purchase $15 putty and return labels multiple times to retry the process. On the positive side, their customer service representative was friendly and helpful, and they provided video support to guide me through the process.  Once my upper impression was finally approved, I sent it in, and they successfully created my upper retainer.  Lower Impression and Retainer  My lower impression was initially approved through email, but after I mailed it in, they claimed it was distorted and needed to be redone. This was frustrating, as the approval had already been given. I understand that evaluating impressions via email can be challenging, but I believe the company should assume responsibility for their approval process. If more pictures were required for an accurate evaluation, they should have requested them upfront rather than rejecting the impression post-shipment.  To resolve the issue, I had to purchase more $15 putty and return labels, which I felt the company should have covered since the mistake stemmed from their approval process. After several attempts and video call support, my final impression was deemed acceptable via video call. I emailed pictures, didn’t receive a reply, and sent it in. Unfortunately, the lower retainer they made does not fit.  I reached out to them several days ago about the ill-fitting retainer but have not received a response. While they did send me a case and retainer cleaning solution as a goodwill gesture, it does not address the unresolved issue.  Overall Impression and Recommendations  The customer service team at Retainers Direct is friendly and willing to help, but the process of creating accurate dental impressions from home seems fraught with challenges. While I appreciate their support, I believe the company needs to take responsibility for approving impressions via email. If an impression is later deemed unacceptable, they should cover the cost of additional materials and shipping.  Additionally, if a retainer is made from an approved impression and doesn’t fit, a refund or replacement should be provided. This is essential to maintain trust and satisfaction with their service.  I rarely leave negative reviews, but I hope this feedback is seen as constructive criticism. With a few process improvements, Retainers Direct could become an excellent option for affordable retainers.Date of experience: November 25, 2024",4

I accepted their offer for a refund on the retainers, but now they’re trying to subtract $20 from my refund to cover shipping and impression costs (as part of their 30-day return policy, but this wasn't applicable as it's not like I changed my mind or anything like that).

I was one of the people that used SmileDirect…and I was used to poor customer service (but always a good product). Before I purchased from Retainers Direct I called and spoke with them. They told me how they are a small mom and pop operation and offer the BEST customer service, and a superior product to other retainer companies. They reassured me that I will be very pleased and they always make sure their customers are happy. Unfortunately, that was the last positive experience I had with Retainers Direct. I ordered my retainers and it took 4x longer to receive than what they quoted to me. I called and emailed and several times and all but 1 of messages were ignored. When I finally did get somebody on the phone and I explained that I have been waiting close to 2 months for my retainers, her response to me was “we are very busy. We have many orders. There’s nothing else I can tell you. You’ll get your retainers as soon as they are ready.” Fast forward - I did get my retainers without having any communication from the company at all. No apologies about it taking so long. No discount code for future orders since the order did take so long and I received such poor service. No tracking # once they did ship. Nothing! Now, the icing on the cake…my brand new retainers cracked after having them 1.5 months. I contacted Retainers Direct to let them know and they told me “we offer a 30 day return policy. Sorry about that, but the only thing I can help you with is ordering a new pair.” I NEVER had retainers crack before with any other company, and I would use them 6 months to a year at a time.  My suggestion for anybody reading this is DON’T purchase your retainers from Retainers Direct. There are other companies - purchase from somebody else. I only wish that I had read a review like the one I’m writing before I ever purchased from Retainers Direct. I hope I’m saving some potential customers from purchasing from this sham of a company. They offer the WORST level of customer service and a terrible product that will not hold up! I cannot begin to tell you how frustrated and angry I am with my experience.

I ordered multiple sets of putty (and the company included a free 3rd set each time which I really appreciated) but still could not get a good impression of my upper. I was getting frustrated.Finally, on my own accord, I went to a local orthodontist where I was lucky enough to receive a ton of help from their impression specialist. We used my last two sets of putty and still couldn't get a good impression. She even commented that their putty is just not up to the job. She used HER OWN putty mix and got me a great impression. Without her I would have been screwed... Got my lower and upper impression to Retainers Direct and before I knew it I had a tracking number. Yay finally almost done! Nope not at all. They sent my retainers to Florida (I live here in Abq, NM so the shipping should've been easy since I'm local). I got ahold of Tanner at Retainers Direct and explained to him the situation. He apologized and said they'd re-ship my retainers with 1 day shipping. 2 days pass and still nothing... so I call back and get ahold of Richard, their retainer specialist. He says he will let Tanner know to call me back. Of course Tanner never calls me back so I call back 2 days later and again Richard picks up. He goes ahead and looks into my retainers for me and says that they were never even shipped... Tanner told me 1 day shipping and never sent them lol what a joke.Richard, an absolute saint, says he will create a new set of retainers for me THAT DAY and will drop them off at the orthodontist where I received help at. I stopped by there the next day to pick them up and finally this grueling process was over.All in all I would've paid more money to get something like this done in person.

ash,US,"Jan 6, 2024","DO NOT USE THIS COMPANYPlease don’t use this company! I cannot speak on quality of the retainer itself because well we’ve still never received them! We received the impression kit quickly but don’t assume they prioritize the turnaround time. And if you think for one minute you’re gonna contact customer service; think again because they answer their phones apparently like once a month. It took me 3 weeks to get someone to answer at the number they provide. Furthermore, It’s nothing like you’d expect when calling a business. There’s no recording with options it just rings and rings like you’re calling a house and then a voicemail picks up and it says nothing more than “Thanks for calling. Leave a message after the beep.” There’s absolutely no identifiable information on the recording to even let you know it’s actually a “business”. Just for some background information we received our impression kit on November 20th and mailed it back on November 21st. Also, there’s no way to look online if or when they received it, what the status is, or any kind of information for your order other than your original order for the impressions. I received an email on December 7 stating “We received your impressions and are currently in the process of crafting your custom retainers. Our typical turnaround time is around 7-10 days. We're currently on track and expect to complete your retainers within this timeframe.” I started trying to contact someone regarding the actual status of our order the on December 11 because I’m certain it didn’t take 16 days for them to receive the impressions. I left message after message on the “voicemail”, sent numerous emails and just FINALLY had someone answer the phone on January 2nd! The gentleman looked up my order and told me the retainers were done and shipping that day and I would receive tracking information that day via email. Well guess what….it’s January 5th and I’ve never received an email nor been able to get ahold of anyone at that number again. I honestly don’t understand how they haven’t been shut down! So here I am almost 7 weeks later and my daughters teeth have began to shift because I thought I was gonna save 700 by using them vs going through her actual orthodontist. We now have an appointment with her orthodontist and I’m uncertain what the outcome will be but I am certain that I didn’t save any money. While I can’t blame them for my daughter losing her retainers I do blame them for promising a service and not providing it in a timely manner or well at all for us at this point. Do yourself a favor, if you’re replacing retainers that are preventing teeth from shifting, go to the orthodontist, use another business, DO NOT utilize this company!Date of experience: January 05, 2024",1

Avo Babikian,US,"Aug 9, 2023","AVOID THIS SERVICEI purchased a set of retainers back in March of 2023. The initial box came with a couple sets of putty and my girlfriend and I attempted to create the mold. Upon a couple attempts, we weren't able to create a proper mold to send back to them. I sent them an email and they stated that we need to buy additional sets of 'putty' which are ($15/ea). We bought additionally sets, and upon mixing the 'putty', it got hard instantly and we weren't even able to attempt to create the mold the second time, this caused months of delay due to shipping, etc..Finally, I decided that I no longer wanted to move forward with them creating my retainers as their system clearly isn't working. I emailed to receive a refund for the amount i paid for the retainers and they denied my request for a refund since the initial order was placed in March. Basically, they aren't giving me a refund for an item that I did not even receive.This company is an outright scam model, in which they give you putty that does not work, which forces you to buy additional putty and causes their refund policy time period to pass and you will be left with no retainers and -$250 in your bank account.Avoid them at all costs.Date of experience: March 15, 2023",1

R. S.,US,"Updated Jul 27, 2023","Tricky Money-Back Policy—Watch OutEverything this company does is designed to ensure that you cannot easily take advantage of their refund policy, even if the retainers they send you are faulty and painful to put on. Despite taking perfect impressions, sending photos of them in advance, and receiving written confirmation from the company that they were good, I received a note with my retainers that said that they had been modified because of distortions. Clearly, the impressions were damaged during shipment (in which case shipping insurance should have picked up the costs), or they were improperly handled during the tray removal process or beyond. The retainers I received were extremely painful to put on. I've been wearing retainers for over five years now; I know the difference between tight retainers and distorted ones. Wearing these ones would have caused long-term changes in the positioning of my teeth.Here are some tricky things about the company that I wish I knew about before I placed my order:1. Customer service is very prompt and friendly before you place an order, but somewhat sporadic, rude, and cursory after you receive your retainers. After ordering, the emails I received from Darren Haltom were either generic form emails or one-liners that avoided directly answering the questions I had about what might have gone wrong in the production process.2. The company does not take responsibility for faulty retainers and will not refund you for production errors.3. You can only use their money-back guarantee within 30 days of placing your initial order, not 30 days of receiving your retainers. Given that you have to receive the impression kit, take impressions, get them approved, send them back, wait for the retainers to be made (8 business days), and finally receive them in the mail, this effectively means that you have about 24 hours to try on the retainers and decide whether or not you need a refund. If you reach out to customer service with an issue, they will stall you with advice, perhaps to try to get you past that 30-day time limit. When I politely explained my issue to Darren, for example, he asked me to send him photos of me wearing the retainers, then waited a couple of days, then insisted they were fine, then asked me whether my teeth had shifted, and finally told me to run the retainers under warm water. This last piece of advice probably takes the prize for ""questionable thing you should probably not do."" If you soften distorted retainers to try to get them on, they cool back down into their original shape and start repositioning your teeth according to their own distortions. Note that each of these emails with Darren takes time. I responded within minutes or hours to each of them, but he would wait a day or a whole weekend between messages, eventually pushing us past the 30-day refund policy. After that, he was like ""gotcha, you lose!"": ""Your order was placed on June 21. The policy states that no shipping costs will be refunded.""4. If you are ordering only retainers and use the 15% off coupon code, you save just $2.50 because you no longer qualify for free shipping, which costs $20. This may seem fine, but if you opt for a refund, you forfeit all $20 of the original shipping fee. If you are absolutely determined to order from this company, you may be better off not using the promotional code and opting for free shipping instead.Date of experience: July 23, 2023",1

The trays sent are too small. My teeth barely fit in, scraping it against the side of the tray. If I attempt to force my teeth in then the tray sits uncomfortably against my gums. I don't know why RD tray sizing is so limited when the company doesn't have the same overhead as in-person dental services and is catering to many people whom they can't access in-person, but I want my money back.Date of experience: July 10, 2023",1

Tierney Elizabeth,US,"Jan 13, 2023","Fast, Easy, and Great Customer Service!Retainers Direct makes getting a new aligner fast and easy. The kit arrived quickly and the instructions were clear. I had my dentist's office help me with making the first impressions... however I think they got smushed in the bubble mailer during shipping to the lab. My first aligner arrived ill-fitting and even looked obviously squished (the central incisors were much shorter than my actual teeth are). Upon messaging the company, they instructed me to take another impression and they would remake it right away. This time I took the impressions myself and sent it in a *box* to the lab, to ensure the impression wouldn't get squished in transit. The lab turned it around within a week and I had a PERFECTLY fitting retainer! So while there was a hiccup with the first try, they definitely did a great job with the second one. They also have fantastic communication. Skip spending hundreds of dollars on retainers from your dentist and just use Retainers Direct!Date of experience: December 06, 2022",5
Colleen P,US,"Jan 13, 2023","Don’t Hesitate!I was nervous about using a mail order retainer service due to the task of a self-made impression, but a replacement retainer with my orthodontist cost $200 so I thought it was worth a try. We received the kit within just a few days of ordering, and the instructions were great. Not only written instructions, but helpful pictures available online plus a video! Additionally, we sent pics of the impressions to get feedback prior to shipping back. The communication was great and when we received the retainer it was a perfect fit. The whole process was completed in 2 weeks which is important. Also this was for my 15yo son so I was nervous about being able to get the impression right for him, he has a small mouth and can’t do bitewing X-rays at the dentist, but the whole process was successful. I would definitely use them again. It’s the exact same quality you would receive from the orthodontist.Date of experience: January 12, 2023",5
Savanah Slone,US,"Jan 12, 2023","Extremely Satisfied AGAIN :))This was my second time using Retainers Direct for my daughters retainers. The whole process is very quick, more convenient and less expensive than going through my daughters orthodontist. The retainers are the same exact quality as retainers previously purchased from her orthodontist but are 1/4 of the cost. I will use Retainers Direct for any of her future retainer needs.Date of experience: January 11, 2023",5

MEREDITH DUNN,US,"Jan 9, 2023Verified","Great communication, needs better packaging for impressionsThe communication was fantastic from the start. My initial impressions needed to be redone - I think the mold got smooshed in the mail.  I hope they no longer suggest sending the impressions back in the padded envelope alone - they really need to be in a box.  Once that was sorted out, the retainers were great.  They fit and didn't hurt.  They are not bulky.  I'm overall very pleased with the experience.Date of experience: December 19, 2022",4
WC,US,"Jan 8, 2023","Terrible customer serviceTerrible customer service. They were quick to respond to emails and would says yes to everything, but at the end didn’t do any of the things they promised and just brushed me off and not even an apology. After paying over $400 for two retainer kits I asked Darren if he could send all the retainers in one larger package instead of two separate packages to ensure it gets delivered to the door as I’m staying at an Airbnb with no access to the mailbox. He said no problem.Later on I told him it might be safer to just deliver to General delivery address so I can pick up at the post office. He said no problem. When I got the delivery notification email I noticed that the address is still the original Airbnb address.  I asked Darren to confirm if the address was changed and his response was he was unable to send a product to general delivery. I questioned why he said no problem in the first place and it would have been nice to let me know before he shipped it. He didn’t give any explanation or apologize and simply said thanks for your understanding. I managed to intercept the package from the postman and not only did they not send it in a large package as they said they would, they only sent one set of the retainers and not both sets I ordered.I emailed Darren again, and rather than checking himself what I ordered and what they shipped out he had to ask me multiple times to confirm my order details and what I received, even though I already said it in my email. When I got the delivery notification for the missing retainers I noticed that it was sent using first class and not priority mail that I paid extra for. I wrote to him to complain about the multiple issues. He did quickly change the delivery to priority mail but never replied to my email . This just shows how much they care about customer satisfaction. Even if I didn’t pay for priority mail you would think they would still try to send out the missing retainers as quick as possible instead of trying to use the cheapest shipping method. The retainers I got do not fit properly but because of the bad communication and customer service I don’t want to deal with them anymore to get it redone.Date of experience: December 16, 2022",2

No problem though I emailed retainer direct and was responded to same day! They resolved the issue and sent me the ""new"" retainers (took 2 weeks to receive fixed pair) and they fit perfect!

Thu Nguyen,US,"Dec 22, 2022","Retainers Direct is awesome!I highly recommend ordering from Retainers Direct. I had a new crown put in which caused my old retainers to no longer fit so I decided to try Retainers Direct. I corresponded with Darren sending each photo impression to get his team's input if it was good to send in, and then I sent in my first impression which ended up not working well. Darren was very understanding and helpful and even sent me a smaller mouth tray to accommodate me for my second attempt. After 2 months of helping me through this entire process I am so glad to say I now have retainers that fit perfectly thanks to Darren and team. Thanks so much!Date of experience: December 22, 2022",5
Jennifer Lee,US,"Dec 13, 2022Verified","Great, reasonably-priced retainers with minimal issuesMy experience with Retainers Direct has been great! My impression kit came very quickly in the mail (around 3 days after). The impressions were rather difficult for me to take in regard to tolerating holding putty in your mouth for 3+ minutes, but that's expected. Otherwise, it is an easy process if you follow directions carefully. I emailed Retainers Direct pictures of my impressions, and was told that they might have issues, but to send them in anyway. I was worried that I would have to order another kit, but the retainers came in the mail a week later (quite quick!) and they are near perfect! I don't know how they fixed the issue with only minimal distortions but they did! The distortions are so minimal that they should not affect the retainers' ability to keep my teeth straight, and the retainers look great overall. The retainers also feel sturdier than those I get from my orthodontist, and at much more a reasonable price! Overall, I am very pleased with this service.Date of experience: December 13, 2022",5
