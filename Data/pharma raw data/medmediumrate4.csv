TLP,US,"Oct 3, 2023","NOT BETTER THAN BEFOREI find it VERY strange that this company's website only has ratings of 4 and 5 stars that show up under their new full spectrum gummy cubes reviews section.  They also recently sent out an email to their listserv that markets these new gummy cubes as a ""better"" version of their old CBD gummies.  However, the new ones are NOT organic, they are NOT non-GMO, and they now use corn syrup as a main ingredient.  Since I am allergic to corn I could not buy these, but my mom did and they smelled rancid.  Her dogs wouldn't even eat them.  When she posted a review on their website, it was removed the next day. This is beyond disappointing.  They are clearly more concerned about making money rather than providing a good quality item as they did before.Date of experience: October 03, 2023",1

I've used these mushrooms in the past and had great experiences every single time, so I was surprised and disappointed that these were a dud. I've been a customer for 2.5 years and spent well over $2,000.00 on their products. They declined to send me a replacement, as too much time has passed. I understand their policy, but I've been a loyal customer and feel like they could have made an exception in my case. I saved the gummies for 3 months in anticipation of my family coming to visit.

I replied, pointing out that they had promised to remove me from their list, and insisting on no further email other than a single confirmation that they had complied. Next day I received yet more SPAM from them. In short, they target people at random, fill up the inboxes of people who have no interest in their product, do not keep their promises, and lie.

Lorna M,US,"Aug 14, 2023","This company needs to get it togetherThis company needs to get it together. Seriously I ordered a larger order and I ordered early enough so I would not run out. But yet I did run out and I get an email stating they are running behind. And they will be delayed a couple of days. 14 days later they haven't even been mailed but they gladly charged my card when they got my order. If you do not have supply to cover the demand, offering a 25% discount on more is not going to fix the problem. I am not going to order more when I can't get the ones I already ordered. I am going to have to find another place to get cbd gummies from. I have a major spinal issue and the cbd gummies are what makes it so I can function without taking any narcotics.

Garlin Lewis,US,"Sep 26, 2022Redirected","CBD salve review. Great products for pain.Bought the 1,000mg extra strength salve from a local cbd shop to help with my back and neck pain. Took away my pain in about 10 minutes and the relief lasted about 3 hrs. It has a peppermint like smell. Loved the smell. I decided to order the 2,000mg maximum strength salve to get the maximum benefit from the pain relief and hope the relief last longer. I still get relief within 10 minutes, but I think the relief is not as good as the 1,000mg extra strength for some reason. Also, there is a distinct smell of hemp. Which is strong. I think I’m going to go back to the 1,000mg extra strength. I think I understand why it smells so strong because its double the strength, so overall the products work very well. Outstanding products!!!Date of experience: September 26, 2022",5

Cynthia Lemmon,US,"Updated Mar 7, 2023","I had an adverse reaction to the…I had an adverse reaction to the gummies, could not move without throwing up for hours and bad vertigo, just sick as a dog. I offered to send product back, they said I would get a partial refund (which I have since received). I did not react to the lotion but have not had pain relief either. My rating is not because I can’t take the product because honestly some people just can’t. My low rating is because it took too long for them to confirm anything about a refund other than an automatic response to my request on 2-23-23, and no one even asked if I was better now or seemed concerned that I had such a bad reaction or even thanked me for describing the reaction for their potential investigation into it. That is why the company gets a lower rating from me. The product is probably great for anyone else. I am over 60 with arthritis and stress and had hoped this was an answer. For me it isn’t, but I suggest sample options for people like me who want to be careful before buying. I would pay for a sample of products first if I had seen the option.Date of experience: February 21, 2023",3

Now, they obviously don't have the staff to cover the customer service issues or even respond. Don't even think that someone is going to answer the phone! They're good at taking your money but that's about it.I ordered some CBD and the order triplicated without being able to tell this happened until way later when my email then showed multiple order confirmations. I immediately reached out to customer service, called, sent emails, instant message..NOTHING....days passed and I recieved 1 email saying I received a refund for 1 order. Then they confirmed, cancelled, and sent tracking on the same order, which of course didn't ship. The third order was in limbo. I've asked them to refund me and still nothing. I've referred a lot of people and now I'm on a mission to reverse that and let others know to keep from spending your money here. It's close to a month and STILL no resolve.

The first night I took one gummie about 30 minutes before I went to bed. I did not feel any real benefit and my sleep was not very good. I thought perhaps I needed a higher dose, so the second night I took two of the gummies. I awoke after being in bed for a couple hours. I had a slight after taste and I still had my usual arthritic pain and had difficulty getting back to sleep. It was not a pleasant night.

I like using the vape process but it would be nice if the  $$$ discount would give a code instead of click for coupon which I don't receive  the amount offered. I have cactus cooler I am starting in a.m. I hope it works for me then I have the blueberry og or kush along with sour D after that it will leave me 4 more to try until I get the one that works for me. I like the delivery system for full spectrum cbd since I can get away from gummies because I am a type 1 diabetic and to not use sugar that's great. But, it would be nice to get some vape samples that could have 3 or 4 doses at 2 puffs each so that could help me in finding the best vape for me. I did get a call from a young lady that could not really answer me about the pain I have and which vape. Delivery would be good for me, and help me with the pain in my mid back after 10 surgeries and all she had said is what I had already read on the web site. I do like the vape delivery she could not even answer questions on battery life. Anyway all together I  ❤️  the system it is getting the vape product that will work for me.

Colin Lechner,US,"Jun 27, 2022","The best of the best!!!!I ordered the indica bundle. It came with Northern Lights, Zkittles, and Skywalker OG. I've ordered from other companies in the past and so far Cheef is the best quality. I'm amazed, I thought CBD flower was working for me before but the quality of this is like 10 times better than what I had before. My very favorite is Northern lights. I can't say enough good things about it. It keeps me calm but most of all I sleep better than ever when I smoke some before bed. This is the best I've ever had, EVER! I've already ordered more of Northern Lights because I don't want to be without! Skywalker OG is my second favorite, it keeps me calm for sure, helps my anxiety. It doesn't help me to sleep well though like Northern lights does. Zkittles tastes amazing but unfortunately its not for me. It made me feel like I smoked sativa, which makes my anxiety worse. It just gave me a jittery feeling that I wasn't fond of. Easily fixable with a bowl of Northern lights or Skywalker lol but Zkittles isn't one I'd personally purchase again. Clearly every strain works differently for each individual so try it for yourself for sure! Overall my experience with cheef has been great! I wish their shipping was as fast as some of the other CBD companies though. It took about 5 days to come where other CBD companies I've ordered from that are in the same area or a state or 2 over have taken 2 days. Thats my only complaint!Date of experience: June 27, 2022",5

After they realize you bought a good amount during a sale they were having they refuse i repeat refuse to make things right. This is an exact quote ""in this situation we prefer to refund and be done with this."" All i wanted was what i ordered which was 4 orders of their wax not melted into a puddle.

Long story short there are plenty of cbd companies that sell high quality cbd, yoy're not the only one Cheef.  Remember when I said they never admitted they knew exactly what happened,At the end of this ordeal I was contacted by a customer service manager or something and she admitted ""yes we are aware that warm weather can affect our concentrates and we are working to resolve this PROBLEM"". This is something that each and every customer should be warned about before their order processes. They are obviously in need of sales b/c there was a month or 2 in between this order and the one before so they sent me an email titled "" is this the end"" with a coupon begging me to order again.

I tried filling out the money back guaranteed form, no response.  I trying to get a return label by phone or email no answer and no response.I purchased four packages of these mushrooms, three are not opened I would like to return and I can't even get a hold of anyone for 2 weeks.  I read the other recent reviews here, others are having the same problem they don't answer anything, don't answer their phone or email if you have a problem.  Ironically before I place the order I had a question and they answered fast via email by the next morning of my email, they're choosing not to answer any return product emails or phone calls.  I would have been repeat customer if it weren't for this, avoid this company all costs. $160 order no money back guarantee response ,no answer for a return label, nothing.  They don't answer their phone and they don't answer their email when you have a return request.  I received an automatic response for the return, saying someone who would get back to me when 24 to 48 hours its now been 2 weeks with many emails sent since, and phone calls where I left a message which is the only option since they don't answer the phone.Avoid this company, there are many good CBD and Amanita Mushroom companies that won't rip you off like this.  If they would have just accept my return I could understand a bad product, and I would still order l, but not after this they don't answer any phone calls or email if you have a problem.I had to get my money back from my credit card company, because of no response from them.

customer,US,"Mar 26, 2023","A Wonderful Discovery That Changed My LifeI discovered Cheef Botanicals by sheer accident. I was taking CBD gummies alongside my depression medication for years, which helped a lot. However, I was curious if there was flower that existed which was strictly CBD. Because quite frankly I miss smoking marijuana but I do not like how THC makes me feel. The reason is that whenever I smoke marijuana with THC it's like all the negative things I think about myself go to the forefront of my mind and then that's all I can think about. It is one of the main reasons why I stopped smoking marijuana.So obviously when I purchased flower from Cheef Botanicals I was skeptical because I was not sure if there truly was flower with just straight CBD. When my 4g of Northern Lights (my personal favorite strain from back in the day alongside white widow, which I hope Cheef Botanicals sells one day) and OG Skywalker arrived I spent the next couple of days smoking each flower when I wanted to relax or felt anxious.I was pleasantly surprised that the flower worked better than the CBD gummies that I had been taking for years and that it truly was just CBD flower. It was an incredible experience to be smoking flower again and to not be getting high, and instead experiencing the relaxation that came with regular marijuana.For the first time since 2010/11 I was back to smoking flower again because I was finally comfortable with it again.What also blew my mind was the absolute sheer quality of the flower that Cheef has. It was sticky, dank, and tasted so good. The color of the flower was absolutely beautiful. I had no idea that straight CBD flower could have any of these qualities. Their flower reminded me a lot of the high quality flower that's available at dispensaries throughout Massachusetts.The packaging too was incredible. One of the hardest things for me back in the day was keeping marijuana fresh. Well the container that the flower comes in is air tight, you can see into the container from the outside but its tinted to keep light out, and they have stay fresh packets inside to keep the flower fresh. It helped me to store my flower safely and not have to worry about having to use it up so quickly.I do miss smoking marijuana with THC, but my mind just cannot handle it anymore. But now I have marijuana with CBD. I truly cannot thank Cheef enough for giving me back something that used to bring me so much joy so long ago.I am now forever a customer and I would highly recommend their flower for anyone like me who misses smoking but cannot handle THC anymore.Date of experience: March 21, 2023",5

William,US,"Jan 15, 2024","Buyer Beware!They won't leave this on their site trust, truth hurts. My Buyer Beware. They set the bar super high with this particular product. If you read the words in how they're describing what this does the effects are a surefire guarantee. All hype in my personal opinion. They say if you're new and never tried it, not familiar you might want to take ""half of one"" because they're so very potent? Laughable! I started with three on an empty stomach and felt nothing. Last two with food felt nothing. I will say it tasted like a basic kid's gummy maybe a bit better than the average but zero effect zero medicine meaning (Amanita D-9 THC +THCP)  this threesome didn't work at all. 1 to 10 score -1 for lack of all things regarding any effects or just feeling elevated fat zero! There was no mood altering effects for what was just pure candy. Candy doesn't help this mans needs in any department. But whoever does their marketing pitch for this stuff and wrote it up for their website a thousand percent oversold on the properties of what this supposedly can do or will do. There word's verbatim ""Your satisfaction is of the upmost importance to us and we want to deserve your 5-star rating. If you are in any way dissatisfied with your purchase, please don't hesitate to contact us. We would be more than happy to assist you with any questions or concerns."" Yes initially they'll respond back via email a few times and seem to care and give you the feel there a legitimate company who's on it and will fix the issue. But once I called them out on their own refund policy in which they basically saying verbatim off of their site:""If your product(s) has been open or used, no problem, we can still refund you if you are unsatisfied with your purchase, just fill out the Refund Request Form first"" .So in reading that it gave me a false sense of security of making a purchase and taking a chance on them. Once I tried communicating about my refund and filling out the form as they asked in which they get back to you within 24 to 48 hours it's been long past that at this point. All the good communication now has stopped nobody wants to keep their word in reference to my refund or appeasement and I just find that pretty disgustingly fraudulent. They say even if the product was used and I told them that I have the empty package to send if they really need back empty trash that's what I'll send them No problem. But keeping your Honest WORD as a so-called business should truly mean everything to them underneath it All. I don't think it does. And until this matter is settled respectfully they have earned my right to put them on a steady bright blast with the most negative spotlight that I can paint ""truthfully"" to help the next person not get ripped off in this way! I purchased this product Dec 31, 23 and today's date is the 15th of January 24. Yes you're truly showing just how upmost importance my business is to you by running away like the common drug dealing corner crooks @""Cheef Botanicals.P.S. Please know when I used my credit card it was for a one time to see if this works. When trying to take my card off the website it wouldn't allow me to. I received this message verbatim: ""That payment method cannot be deleted because it is linked to an automatic subscription. Please add a payment method, before trying again."" I had to go through the hassle of getting it taken off ASAP. I don't want my card linked to ineffective gummy candy charges every month? That's stupidly unprofessional of them why would I want to buy for the next month when I don't even know if your product even works first? The fact that it absolutely wasn't working makes this whole thing more rip you off fraudulent.Date of experience: December 31, 2023",1

Aly,US,"Jan 28, 2022Verified","Not recommended for anxiety!!! Makes you drowsyI bought Cheef’s CBD Gummies (no THC) with high hopes that they would help with my severe social anxiety while ate work, and during the day. Taking these make me very drowsy and unable to focus. Almost like a sleepy/ confused high. Since I had initially bought them for every day use, I am giving the low rating. They say they offer a money back guarantee, but their request form doesn’t populate when you open it. They say you have to use the product for 30 days, but if you use more than 30% of the product, it doesn’t qualify for a refund. I’m sorry, what? …. The gummies taste a little hempy and medicinal, but in a good way. They’re a good solution for someone who has trouble sleeping. Unfortunately, these are not good for people with anxiety since you can’t use them during the day. Sadly, this defeats their purpose in my opinion.Date of experience: January 28, 2022",2
CBD user,US,"Jan 25, 2022Verified","Bring back your caramels and I will become a customer again.I loved cheef chews CBD caramels and felt they worked very well so was hoping the new products would be as good. The gummies are not what I desire. The pieces are huge and covered with huge sugar crystals. I felt my teeth dissolving every time I ate a gummy. I’m taking CBD to ease pain, not to enjoy candy. It was all too much, too much sugar, too large pieces, and too many flavors to choke down to get my daily dose of pain relief. I prefer a much smaller “punchy” gummy in a tray but those products lost quality too. I now take nano technology products that are working for me. Not cheap, but I do get pain relief without daily tooth decay.Date of experience: January 25, 2022",2
