Ranzie,US,2 days ago,"Customer Service 2nd to none. Awesome experienceI can not say how very pleased I am with Opticontacts.  This was my 2nd order with them since my 14 year daughter started wearing contacts a few months ago.   My daughter had a special event for this weekend. We had been asking her about her contacts and she kept telling us she had plenty.   Well Sunday night 5 days before the event she tells us she only has 2 of the left eye/RX  none for the right.  We immediately placed an order, and requested that whatever upgrades could be done we would pay.    They responded first thing Monday morning that they would upgrade and get them out ASAP.   Then that afternoon I got a message saying they had to order out for the contacts and I knew then they weren't going to make it.  Well around lunch time Tuesday, I get an email saying your order has shipped and is coming 2 day FEDEX.  We had the contacts on Thursday afternoon.  Unfortunately her event was cancelled as a result of the winter storm in the south, but just the fact that they did all of this to ensure we had what we needed.   This type of customer service exist slim to none these days.   They have made me a long term customer. I am just so pleased with them.   Date of experience: January 01, 2025",5

Christi McLin,US,"Jan 4, 2025","Better prices than anywhere elseThey matched my price from previous order(from 2019). Their contacts are a lot cheaper than 1-800 contacts. I use Bausch and Lomb Ultra contacts. I paid $27 per box, whereas at 1-800 contacts it would have been $40 per box. Shipping was also fast.

The contacts have very good expiration dates. I am a very happy customer. My only criticism is the handling fee they add at the end of check out. The price you first see is not the price you are actually going to pay. Regardless, I am still happy with the price I paid in comparison to what other places are selling the contacts for. I would have no problem ordering from this company again in the future if they continue to beat out their competition in prices. Thank you opticontacts! Date of experience: December 07, 2024",5

The contacts may have expired a bit before other sources, but way beyond what you would wear them for anyway.  i.e. you should wear them within six months and they expired years in the futureI was also skeptical about their prices.  They were lower than about anyone else I could find, so I thought there could be problems.  However it was just the opposite.  I did have an issue where my doctor gave me the wrong PX, but OptiContacts was great about refunding my money on the unopened boxes and were quick to help me get the right ones.This may sound like a fake review, because it is all good, but I can tell you it is totally legit.  Actually, I rarely take the time to do a review, but this experience was so good, I felt I needed to.I have found a source for all my contact needs as long as they are in business, and continue with their competitive pricing and outstanding customer service.Date of experience: October 04, 2024",5

Marlane,US,"Aug 9, 2024","Very happy with product until this last batchUp until this year I have been very happy with the contacts but this last batch I received in May 2024 have not been so good. I see that they were shipped from England. I don’t know if that makes a difference but twice the contacts broken in half in my eye (that has never happened in the 40 years I’ve worn contacts) and the last contact I put in a couple days ago had a chip in the perimeter. So I was very disappointed in this lot box I received. In talking to customer service they responded very quickly to my concern and are sending me another box of contacts but now I am a bit leery about wearing them, wondering if they are going to break again in my eye, which is very very painful.
