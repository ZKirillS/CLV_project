I told her I‚Äôd come back and took a picture of the products. She got upset with me and asked me to delete them. I didn‚Äôt luckily because I was able to remember the products and name of business. When she realized I wasn‚Äôt going to buy anything she turned from being nice to rude and hurtful. She snatched the products away from me and turned towards the door to schmooze another unlucky soul.

Luis Lascano,EC,"Nov 21, 2024","Fraud! Scam!I had a very unpleasant and fraudulent experience with Gratiae - Hermetise Cosmetics at their kiosk in Dolphin Mall, Miami. Initially, I was approached with samples, but the situation quickly escalated into a high-pressure sales tactic involving rude and manipulative behavior from their staff. They applied products without my consent and insisted on selling items at varying prices with damaged packaging.The worst part was when my card was taken from my hands without permission, and they processed a $53.50 transaction without properly informing me or showing a return policy. Soon after, I experienced an allergic reaction to the sample applied on my wrist, leading me to return the product within 30 minutes. However, the staff were dismissive, rude, and refused a refund, instead insisting on an exchange despite my clear discomfort and dissatisfaction.I left the product at the kiosk, but this entire ordeal was distressing and unethical. Upon researching, I found numerous complaints and allegations against this company online, which align closely with my experience. Avoid this company at all costs‚Äîdeceptive practices like this should not be tolerated.They claim no responsibility for the franchise's policy or behavior; totally wrong; if they rent their brand they should be responsible if they rented their brand to criminals.Date of experience: October 25, 2024",1

I took their products to a professional dermatologist, a real doctor, a real professional not a salesresp bullshitter like the ones they have in the stores, and she told me those ingredients are made for you to use them, damage your skin and then get some a lot more expensive for them so it can repair the damage.

There is a beige tint to this product and the way the salesperson held the mirror it looked like the bags under my eyes were gone.  All an optical allusion.  I have been using this for 2 months now and nothing has changed at all.  I still have bags under my eyes. Another thing you can't wear this as a concealer because when it dries it cracks and is very noticeable so you can only use it at night while you are sleeping and it DOES NOT gradually tighten the skin under your eyes so the bags are gone.

This guy came out and tried all his sales tricks on me - I looked younger than my ages (I'm 29...), - took the price down from $159 to $47.

Donna Munro,CA,"Updated Sep 9, 2023","SCAM SCAM SCAMWe purchased the wrinkle eraser and exfoliant after a demo at the CNE in Toronto. The cream the guy used on our faces immediately lifted deep wrinkles and totally erased the bags from under my husbands eyes. We paid $200 each for the wrinkle cream and $75 for the exfoliant and when we got home and used the product it was nothing like the product they used on us in the demo and did absolutely nothing. In the demo the product balled up giving the appearance it was taking off your extra dead skin but I discovered it's the "" actual product "" that balls up and it did the same thing when I applied it to a piece of paper. What a rip off this company is and they tried to use high pressure sales tactics on us which didn't work and we purchased of our own free will knowing it was way overpriced but I must say I didn't expect the product itself to be a different product and therefore actual trickery and deceit involved. The lady came over and tried to sell me an $8000 face machine afterwards and when I asked her if she was "" high "" she said I'll give it to you for $4000. I told her she'd met her match and moved on and she said ""don't you want to look good "" ? to which I replied "" Don't I already look good"" ? this company is misrepresenting their products in the worst way and I would steer very clear of them. They all seem to be engaging in very high pressure sales tactics and were not honest and basically scammed us.

The chair was turned to the back of the store and I felt trapped. Regretfully, I purchased the items for $200. He was quick to run the credit card but he did not give me my items and distracted me by asking me to sample their eye cream which made my skin tingle and felt uncomfortable. Then talked to me about a face mask. He said items and another product would cost $699, cheaper than the internet price of greater than $1000. I declined and he marked them down to $149. At this point, I realized this is a scam. No returns, BTW. Only exchanges. He ignored me repeatedly when i told him I had to leave and asked me to try their salt rub and then their facial. Offered a free facial and tried to get me to go to the back room. I felt extremely uncomfortable. Should have been rude and given him the alternatim to call security. Beware.

The luxurious formula of both products feels indulgent, and the packaging exudes sophistication.The serum's lightweight texture glides on effortlessly, absorbing quickly without any greasy residue. I noticed an immediate hydration boost, and over time, fine lines around my eyes visibly diminished. The powerful blend of ingredients seems to work wonders for firmness and elasticity.Complementing the serum, the eye cream adds an extra layer of nourishment. Its rich consistency feels incredibly moisturizing, leaving the delicate skin around my eyes feeling supple. I appreciate that it targets puffiness and dark circles, giving my eyes a refreshed and well-rested appearance.What sets Hermetise apart is not just the product efficacy but also the attention to detail in packaging and presentation. The sleek design of the bottles enhances the overall experience, making it a treat for both the eyes and the senses.While the price point may be higher compared to some other options on the market, the visible results and the overall luxurious experience make Hermetise Age Delay Eye Serum and Eye Cream a worthwhile investment for those seeking a premium skincare solution.Date of experience: November 20, 2023",5

Here is what I have also sent to the BBB:I was walking through the mall while on the phone and was offered a sample from a saleswoman. I said thank you and tried to walk off but she grabbed my hand and said she wanted to show me her products. She didn't care that I was on the phone and I didn't know what to say and didn't want to be rude. She put the collagen peel on my hands and showed me how it worked. I said that it was very nice but I can't afford it and she asked if I was a Cos t Co member. I said yes... Then she said she can offer me a $200 discount. I still was unsure about purchasing but she kept saying how great a deal it was and that I will love it.

Yesterday I went to La Cantera in San Antonio, Texas and was brought into the store by a woman handing out sample lotions in front of Hermitage. She called me with the word My Love and I was uncomfortable but I could get access to the products she recommended and tested. She offered me a high price for a product that wasn't very special, so I said I'd read reviews of the brand, look into the ingredients, and come back, so she changed her face to a stiff face and an unfriendly tone and dealt with the price down. Introducing and selling products is their job. And they work in the service sector. The service industry may not always be, but employees should respond to customers with a basic mindset of the service industry, and it is ridiculous that if customers listen to them well, they are kind and if they don't listen to them, they change their faces immediately.Customers have heard the product description but do not buy it, it is the customer's right and free will. And the price down doesn't make sense either. The Peeling product introduced as $299 suddenly becomes $84 and the 141 product becomes $49. It must be a fraud to see that the price more than tripled on the spot means how much the product costs, and that even though the price has fallen, there is a profit left for them. Eventually, I bought a $49 peeling product after a little scuffle, and when I got home, she had paid $50. It was $1 but it was really enough to ruin my mood, and my trust in this company and its products was completely lost, so I threw the products I bought into the trash can. I'd buy a lawyer if it was a little more expensive. In order for a company to succeed, it is the integrity of its products and trust from its customers. There have been many cases of reviewing the same bad experiences as well as me, but I don't understand if companies are sitting on their hands.  Is the company admitting and proving itself to be a fraudulent company?Date of experience: April 26, 2021",1
Steve Rogers,CA,"Apr 17, 2023","Disgraceful sales tactics designed to prey on the vulnerableThis is the most predatory and shameful business I have ever encountered in my life. Like others, I was ambushed at my local mall by a pushy saleswoman who lured me into their kiosk with a free sample (I can only blame myself for that one). Next thing I know, I'm in a chair having product after product applied to my face while the woman drones on about how much I need them for my skin. I knew immediately where this was going and that it wouldn't end well, because there was no chance in hell that I was buying anything. Lo and behold, we get to the end and I'm told that I can buy the whole set of products for a whopping $650! As if. I told her to take a hike, but she continued to prod, using every sales tactic under the sun to try and pressure me into buying something; it's a special promotion only for today, I'll throw in another cream for free if you promise not to tell anyone (""can I trust you?"" she said), bringing the price down to an eventual $140 and then asking how I would like to pay, etc etc. It was obvious that she was desperately hunting for a sale. Well luckily I had enough fortitude to stand my ground and say no. And let me tell you, she was visibly angry when it became clear that I wasn't budging. The experience prompted me to hop online to look for reviews and now I learn that so many others have experienced the same thing. However I am absolutely horrified to see the amount of people that actually bought the damn products! Jeez people, you must learn to say no! But there's no denying that their sales tactics are slimey, dangerous, and EFFECTIVE. I can absolutely see how this approach would work on a lot of people. As my titles indicates, it is designed to fleece you and take advantage of your politeness and people-pleasing tendencies. They will pitch to you at an intentionally high pace so that you are never given a single moment to think; always either talking about or demonstrating the product, or asking you personal questions to create the illusion of buddy-buddy friendliness. Be aware, they are experts at taking complete control of the situation so that you can never feel truly grounded and level-headed. Please remember, this is NOT the time to be ""nice"" and buy something you don't need just to make a filthy salesperson happy.

OMG they work!!!  If I was made of money, fine, when they initially try to push you for the ridiculous price. But then they drop the price over and over like a used car salesman does. Why!!! Just charge the lowest price you give and more will buy. Supply and Demand. Then these reviews about your sales tactics will go away and  be replaced by glowing ones. LITERALLY GLOWING (FROM USING YOUR PRODUCTS!) TRY THEM, REALLY TRY THEM. You will so no need to push such Shaddy tactics. I'm mortified to recommed your products in fear those will be taken advatange of or embrassed by the online reviews. As a former VP of Sales and Marketing in a different industry you are causing reputation damage for what? Those few that buy at your outrageous first offer?! How about this just sell those same few more products? Gain more market share.  That way when they figure you out, they rave about the products instead of filing complaints for the shady tactics. Otherwise slowly over time (I'm sure you're feeling it already) you're amazing products will become obsolete. I think your products are way too good and probably the best ever of what I've used in my time - Image, Obagi, Color Science and very expensive ones like Le Mer and La Prairie. $100 a jar is plenty. You're welcome! Only because it's true and my skin is witness 44yrs of age going on 30. I have 20 somethings coming after me all the time. They're not my type but someone's for sure!Date of experience: October 23, 2022",4
Mary Jovic,CH,"Nov 25, 2020","Very strange storeVery strange store, I could not believe something like this could happen to me in Zurich.I was lured by a young man standing at the entrance of the store giving me a handcream sample. I took it and somehow few seconds later I ended up at the chair. He started putting products on my hands, on my face and asking me questions about my age, my job my relationship, products I use. But I had no chance to answer to his question as he answered them himself. He didn't stop talking. I had to go but I had no chance to say that. He spoke so fast and did his treatments, I got so angry but stayed polite.In the end I bought a nailpolish for 99.-Then wanted to leave finally, but he again put me on the chair and started speaking about presents. He wants to give me this and that and even a facial treatment, the only thing I should do is tell my friends how great the products are.Then he took a calculator and entered some figures and saying, it will only cost 16chf per month. And I go, but you said you give me as a present. And he goes, he will give me the peeling and the facial, but I pay 300 for the serum. And then I ask how does he think it's 16 chf per month.He goes because it lasts a year. I said I'm sorry, I will not buy anything. Then he tried again to sell me another product for half price. Then I left. I was in the store for 45mins.Very annoying treatment. Don't go there unless you want to spend few hundreds for products.Date of experience: November 25, 2020",1

Alexxi Porter,US,"Jul 7, 2021","Poor product and rude StaffI posted a review which they just removed because it was negative I had stopped in the morning and bought product with Nicole and booked a facial that afternoon, before a ""medical convention"" she had to go too. I was to have brought 4 products.  She circled the products she sold me on the paper with instructions on how to use.As I was walking to the afternoon facial, a man (her manager) at a sister store said Nicole told him, about my facial and he was coming down so she could go to the medical conference.  At the facial, she tried to sell me more products. Nicole was so rude when I told her no. She told me ""but you will spend $200 on a dinner?""  ""You don't have time - that is just an excuse.  Everyone has time""   She was really shaming and blaming me!!  Then, she got her manager in the room.  Neither one would let me out of the room for awhile, either!! Within the hour, my face was red, itchy, and burning with a mild rash.  I immediately went back to the store and she said ""That's good it is red, itchy, and rash, and hot.  That means it is working"".  I reminded her I did not get the facial that warmed and heated, as she offered.  Rather, I got the cooling collagen treatment.  She said she would not return anything.  I left my review and emailed Hermetise.  Hermetise corporate office to Declined to get involved I stopped by the sister stores where Nicole‚Äòs manager worked and they refused to help.  They actually said none of it was their product; they had never seen it before. Curious, Nicole's manager would work there!  That night, after benadryl and treatment for the itchy and rash, I noticed I was given eye removal instead of the eye cream, Nicole circled on the paper and I was missing the 24 hour tightening and brightening cream. The next day, I stopped in the store but Nichole wasn't there and no one would help me. I stopped at another sister store who also refused to help.  they said I had to go back to the original store for an exchange.Date of experience: July 07, 2021",2

Jessi Fisher,US,"Jan 25, 2024","I was first given a free sample of‚Ä¶I was first given a free sample of Hermetise at a resort in Hawaii. I fell in love, but when I went on the website I wasn't prepared for the pricing. However, I believe quality should come at a price so I saved up and nearly a year later purchased my first product directly via the Hermestise website. I placed the order on January 11, 2023. I immediately received an email confirmation for the order saying I would receive shipping info shortly. A couple days went by and nothing. Then five days. Then six. Finally I decided to reach out and see if there was an issue since I found it odd that a week had passed with no additional contact. I used the live chat option to speak with a customer service rep directly on the Hermetise website. The very first thing the rep typed to me was ""what's the order number"" not a hello, my name is, thank you for being a customer, nothing. I gave them the order number and the next thing I received was simply, ""need shipping address."" I was somewhat taken aback with the bluntness, I expected at least a ""thank you for that info, could you also provide me with the shipping address please?"" But I guess they were trying to save time. I provided the address and explained that I had placed an order a week prior and had not heard anything since. The rep told me that they needed to verify the shipping address since it differed from the billing address. I totally understand this and appreciate them wanting to double check, but it had been a week and I had not received one email or phone call asking for verification. My email and phone number was right on the order confirmation, so they had it all. The rep said they had tried to reach me but I double checked both my email and junk mail and phone records but showed no missed calls, no voicemails and no follow-up emails. Once I was able to verify my shipping address with the rep I instantly received an email with shipping confirmation. I am somewhat disappointed with not only the way the rep addressed me in the beginning but also the fact that I paid nearly $400 for a product and no one would have done anything if I hadn't have reached out to find out what the issue was. I would expect much better customer service from a luxury company such as Hermetise. I was a little put off by the experience but thankfully the product is so great I will more than likely order again. I'm just letting you know so this doesn't happen to anyone else in the future.

Then once I was getting to know her I brought up a concern that I had. I had purchased the peeling mask and a suringe filler about 3 or maybe even 4 years ago. I put it in my closet and never used either. I knew that were good products, however I was confused as to how to use them. The guy at the Kiosk in Austin, Texas was smooth in showing me but no instruction sent home on either product. I got brave about a year or so ago and tried the mask. It barely had any in it (from evalopation I guess) and I used what little was in the jar. I used it and I had a couple of folks mention that my skin looked smoother. I got in touch with your customer service to let me know that I didn't use either product but did try the mask and hoping I could get a new bottle of it. No one returned my email. I called and left numerous messages with customer service it was so frustrating. I went ahead and ordered more of the peeling mask. I explaned all of this to Alex. She was son patient and anxious and personable to help me. I feel so much better about using your products now that I know you guys will help me with these products. I am older woman and sometimes instruction on how to works for me. Thanks to Alex she provided me an email and ask me to send a pic of the filler tube.

Unfortunately, that's when two high pressured salesmen started their spiel. First they claimed the moisturizer they were putting on my mom was worth thousands, but they eventually dropped the price to $300. Then they began using a wand to help wrinkles, that they claimed was also worth thousands. My mom did see a temporary difference in her eye puffiness, so she thought the cream was real. She did ask if she wasn't satisfied, if she could return the items, and they said of course. She ended up purchasing the $300 cream and called me. I immediately found reviews of the Hermetise cream and found many other women had been conned with this same spiel around the country and Florida. Their claims are the cream they bought doesn't work as well as the cream they were shown in the store.

She said "" COME IN COME IN "". She showed me some skin care and said it was $5000,00 but she really liked me as a friend and would give it to me for $400.00. I told her I did not have that much. She said since I was her friend she would give it to me for $300.00 and like a fool I bought it. Wentto pay and soon as they ran my card a girl came out of the back saying I will give you a free facial, I am a licensed dermatologist. I went back and laid on a table where for 45 long minutes she tried to convince me she wanted to seel me a $10,000 facial machine for $5,000.00 because she liked me and was my friend. She kept saying you have the money , I can tell by your jewelry. She got really mad at me and while I was trying to leave she insisted I must have this cream on after she used the machine on my face. I drove 1 hour and 30 minutes home and looked in the mirror and the left side of my face had droped like I had had a stroke. Its been 3 days now and my face is ruined. I believe when she got so mad at me for not buying the machine she put some chemical on me to cause harm.

Tanja,CH,"Sep 25, 2020","Zurich Schop - disaster!Dark-haired, small, young lady approached me with the question: ‚ÄúCan I ask you, what kind of cosmetic products do you use?‚Äù. She was already behind me, and I wanted to be polite and turned back to her direction.Here is the conversation which took place afterwards: I asked: -Why are you asking me about products I use, this is private and very personal information? If you want to sell me something you can start from this point straight away. -I ask what I want and how I want, you understand?!!!-Why do you raise your voice? Any other ways to talk to people?-I speak how I want, and you don‚Äôt F*C* my day, just because of you are here!!!-The way you talk is disgusting. Where is your manager?-Get out of here!! Go away!!! I do my job, you understand?!!!I have insisted on talking to somebody from the store. The lady (sorry, hardly can call her ‚Ä¶ lady), took a cigarette and started to smoke in front of the shop with the colleague. Her hands were shaking, she was still screaming something on the street while I was in the shop. The young man started to talk to me. I have asked him, how is that possible to treat people and may be your future customers that way? How someone, who work for the company, sell the beauty products can use the word ‚Äúf*c*‚Äù and shout at people? I have asked him to give me a name of that shouting woman. He has refused to give me her name‚Ä¶ I asked why not? She is a member of the team, she works here, why do not give the name? He answered in a very primitive way:-        Because you want to do something bad. I do not want to give you the name.I said that I have the right to complain about services and quality provided in this city and country if I feel so, if you do not give her name, ok, give me the phone number and the name of the manager. He did not want to provide me that information. At the end he gave me the phone number and name. I am 99% sure, this was NOT his manager‚Äôs contact details. The shouting lady came back from her smoke. None of them were wearing the masks in the shop whole time I was there! She calmed a bit down, but started to attack me with the questions like: Who you are, and what kind of job are you doing?...As a fact, I have a good paying, but hard and responsible job. What about if I would not have one? Does it allow her to abuse me or someone else who does not have a job? ‚Ä¶I was about to leave that strange place, and said that I will leave you now, but I will not leave it. They have to be responsible for what they do and say. Shouting lady started to apologize (loud, almost screaming) and the man, I was talking to, brought me‚Ä¶. You think what? Drink! Something strange, yellow in a small glass. This highlights their hospitality and a problem-solving solution, indeed! Does he really think I will drink it???!!!The staff do not speak German at all! Being in the centre of Zurich, they try to sell very expensive products in English, in their very rude, unprofessional, impolite way! Their English is ‚Äúbroken‚Äù too! Where did they get here from?!I hope the shouting-smoking-dark-haired lady will be fired very soon. There is no place to work for such abusers!I DO NOT accept the apologies and will contact a main office in the UK, will find out who is the manager and proceed with legal actions! I expect your reply as soon as possible. Thank you.Kind regards,TanjaDate of experience: September 25, 2020",1

Malinda Maestas,US,"Sep 22, 2020","Extremely dissapointedAfter reading all the negative reviews I to was  scammed.  My mom, daughter and myself went to Sedona, AZ for a girls trip for mothers day and were pulled into the store by a very nice lady that wanted to show us her products.  She began by putting the wrinkle remover cream under my eyes and around my mouth.  It appeared to instantly remove wrinkles and and restore lost volume under my eyes.  I purchased 2 of the Hermetise wrinkle remover for $200 each and thought I was done.  Another gentlemen (Israel guy) pulled us to the back and started in on his sales pitch.  Very pushy, would not let us leave.  After about 2 hours I walked out spending about $1200.00.  I had such buyers remorse after leaving there that it ruined our girls day out.  After using the product at home, the results were not the same.  The Yubari King wrinkle remover was dried up and clumpy and left a residue.  The remaining products are still under my bathroom sink.  I am so upset with myself to be taken advantage of.  All the workers in the store were from another country and used the same high pressure sales tactics.Date of experience: September 22, 2020",1

Zee,US,"Updated Sep 18, 2020","Hermatise scamLike some of the others here, I got sucked in and scammed.  I was walking through a hotel on the riverwalk in San Antonio and was aggressively approached by a you man.  He talked so fast I could hardly keep up, he started using some products on me.  Asked me my age and acted ‚Äòsurprised‚Äô I was that old.  Proceeded to ise this product and that product and told me the ‚Äòprice‚Äô and said he would sell it to me for ‚Äòhalf price‚Äô, I thought that was a steal too.  My fianc√© was there and he was just as gullible as me.  I asked this young man where he was from and he said Isreal where the Dead Sea is.  Then he started talking about it being the land of Jesus, which it is.  Didnt occur to me till later that evening when I started thinking about it, that he probably kept us suckered because he was trained to notice things that could rope us more in.  My fianc√© has an I Love Jesus tattoo on his throat that was plainly seen.  This man then kept telling me that he didnt believe my age and wanted to see my drivers license, so I showed it to him and he didnt even look nor make a comment about my birth year.  AGAIN after going over it in my head later, he was probably disguising that so he could verify my identity to my card.  I had had dinner and some drinks so I was happy.  Normally I am very suspicious of people.  STUPID me got roped into $1800 worth.  That evening after thinking about this, I looked at my products and I had 3 different brands of stuff.  I started doing my research and found all but 2 products I could get off Amazon for under $100.  I was PISSED to say the least.  The next morning when I went to confront him, him and his buddies were gone.  I filed a dispute with my bank.  PLEASE WATCH OUT for people.  He said his name was Daniel and he gave me the phone # of 210-872-0591.  I haven‚Äôt called the number yet as I am waiting for the dispute.  Interesting enough, after I asked him, he said ‚Äòthey‚Äô had shops in Vegas, NY and Boston and where getting ready to open one there.Date of experience: September 18, 2020",1

Dawn James,GB,"Mar 18, 2020","I purchased the Yubari wrinkle eraser‚Ä¶I purchased the Yubari wrinkle eraser last week and am totally disappointed. When I was approached in the street to try out this cream I did not realise  the whole thing is a scam. The charming well trained Sales gentleman talked me into buying the cream After demonstrating the cream on my eyes which did show a vast improvement.  However on trying at home for one week now this cream does not work. If you put too much on you are left with tiny white globules on your skin and if you put very little, no difference at all,  on top of all this I was told I would  get a FREE trial of cream for wrinkles around my mouth.  I turned up the next day to be confronted by a lady with a clipboard wanting me to fill in a detailed form and then introduced to a Dr who tried very hard to persuade me to purchase materials at a cost of $7000+!  It was all very pushy and demoralizing.  It was like Timeshare all over again!  I am now advising all my friends to not enter any of your stores around the world after this terrible experience of hard sell.Date of experience: March 18, 2020",1

Ami Lyn,US,"Mar 16, 2020","Mall scam! Not same product!I just purchased the eye syringe and loved the results from the counter when I purchased at the del amo fashion center. I was so excited to continue my journey to healthier skin but when I opened the box, it was a different syringe container and a completely different company name. I tried to give benefit of the doubt but when I tried the product at home it did nothing. The product demonstrated and the product I bought were not the same.

dissapointed,US,"Mar 12, 2020","While walking through the mall a very‚Ä¶While walking through the mall a very handsome man asked me to try a lotion.  I said sure, then he said sit down and proceeded to show me how I can look younger with this eye cream and I was interested and thought that was the area of my face that I would like to work on,  so, after $500 in purchases, he told me we were going to take a walk to the salon for a facial.  OK, I went along with it.  Then while having this facial selling session a very handsome man was telling me that this is so afordable for what the product does.  I told him several times, I was not going to spend $5000 on face creams etc.... He was very relentless,  ( that is good training on his part)  He was a very good salesman but would not let up at all.  I just wanted to go home.  But he kept perswading me to buy this line.  I kept telling him I could not afford it.  He wanted me to tell him about my finances and he would show me how I could afford to buy the product.  I was in this little room with him for almost 3 hours.  I needed to get back home.  All I wanted to do is walk around the mall.  He kept making deals for me and I felt like I was trapped.  I ended up feeling very wore down and just wanted to leave and bought the producdt line.  The next day, without even opening anything, I called and said I just cant do this it is just to expensive.  He said, sorry we dont take returns.  WHAT!!  everything is returnable, But NO no returns.  So I wrote to the main office and the same thing not returns.  I will not have to get a lawyer involved because this is rediculous.  The a company will not take returns on their product.  Very Dissapointed!Date of experience: March 12, 2020",1
