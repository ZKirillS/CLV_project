Washington DC Lawyer,US,"Nov 15, 2024","Loyal customer for 10 yearsI've been buying Lola products since 2014 when there weren't any other clean, cotton-only period products. Lola was the only brand thinking about its consumers and our safety and comfort. I have used their tampons, liners, pads, and period underwear. Lola has been consistent with its quality of its products and have only improved from there. I was able to pause my subscription while I was pregnant which was great to not have to think about and keep clicking ""skip next order"" lol! I have also followed the company for years and have seen their efforts to increase accessibility to its products and reflect on whether they are being inclusive in the representation within the company. If you haven't switched over from a big brand with tons of chemicals, I suggest you switch over to Lola! They are tried and true. Date of experience: November 15, 2024",5
Julia,US,"Nov 12, 2024","Great customer experience!I've ordered this ph-balanced lube for years and it recently started burning when I used it so I switched to a different brand. However, I left a review stating this and their customer service is awesome! They reached out and tried to clarify exactly what my symptoms were and why I was unhappy and refunded my purchase without me even asking. Very solid customer service even if the product isn't working well for me anymore.Date of experience: November 12, 2024",4
Hasnat Ahmed,GB,"Oct 28, 2024","I was surprised by the abrupt response…I was surprised by the abrupt response to my query when I asked if my blue light card would be accepted. This was at the Lola concession at Victoria. I am a forces veteran and would have appreciated a more polite rejection, rather than 'ONLY NHS'. It's the second time I have received such 'cold' responses to my queries and I will not be going a third time. I will also let all my friends, ex forces colleagues, and friends know about my experience. I hope that Lola's customer facing training is given an uplift, as currently it is, in my opinion, unsatisfactory. Thank you for your time. Date of experience: October 28, 2024",1

Unfortunately the first time I realized it too late.  Their company use to have awesome customer service, but in the last year or 2 it's gotten really bad.

Jenny Reidler,US,"Oct 31, 2020","Probably the worst brand of tamponsProbably the worst brand of tampons. I decided to give these a try and instantly regretted it after only seeing the applicator. I had nothing else on hand so had to use them. I have been using tampons for 20 years and never had such a hard time inserting a tampon! They leak like crazy and are super uncomfortable. Bring on the chemicals cause this hormonal lady does not need any more reason to be a cranky B.

Jessica,US,"Feb 20, 2023","Worst tampons!Wow, I see alot of people had the same issue. The tampons I used since I started my period were discontinued so I had to start shopping around. I tried lola, the super plus and super hurt me for some reason, so I tried a regular and when I went to pull it out, it unraveled inside of me. I have cotton bits inside of me, its painful and has a burning type sensation. Women should have products they feel comfortable with and don’t have to worry about getting infections. This is so unacceptable. As long as I have had my period, this has never happened to me again. Cheap products for an expensive price for something women need.Date of experience: February 20, 2023",1

The applicator is to big causing issues with with the first one I tried causing me to take it out and use another. I didn’t think much of it at first but it was shedding BAD. I wanted something that was healthier but now I’m going to have to buy a bunch of products to thoroughly clean myself out so I don’t get toxic shock from undoubtedly the large amount of fibers left behind.

It made my life easier, as I usually visit the store on a separate trip just for this. I also love that the cotton is organic. Because of this, however, these aren't as absorbent as other brands. Sometimes it would seem that my flow would travel straight to the string without soaking the tampon hardly at all. I preferred the way my other brand worked, but because of the organic cotton and ease of ordering, I continued buying from Lola.Date of experience: September 23, 2020",4

The orders should be fulfilled and if issues arise, an email should be sent to let customers know the eta of shipping.

Erin B.,US,"May 18, 2021","Shredding TamponsI really wanted to like these tampons, as I’ve become allergic to the brand I had been using my whole life thus far. Unfortunately, these just weren’t a good fit. They are bulky and don’t absorb much beyond the outside edges of the tampon. The applicator is nearly impossible to get right on the first try without having to pull the whole thing out and start over. However, the worst part was that the tampon shredded apart when removing, leaving part of it inside. My very kind boyfriend had to dig out the remaining piece. I was really excited to try a natural brand, but these did not live up to my expectation or hope for this product.Date of experience: May 18, 2021",1

I am down to using the cardboard tampons only. The pad and liner were not as absorbent as Always products for a heavy bleeder. The cleansing wipes aggravated my skin. The cardboard tampons I really like because you can get a combination of sizes in one box, natural ingredients, and home delivery.

I love how easy it is to update subscriptions, and I love having a subscription, especially since I will continue sheltering in place and only going out for essentials.

I experienced a lot of friction. Never happened with the previous brand i used. When i pulled out the applicator from down there, i noticed the open edges had pulled few strands from the tampon. Freaked me out. The overall quality and design including the hanging thread needs improvement. Going through menstruation comes with its own frustration.

SWilliamsJD ,US,"Updated Nov 11, 2020","I do not recommend Lola Tampons & PadsI do not recommend Lola tampons or pads. Let's start with the tampons: (1) The plastic applicator is bulky and often comes apart while you are trying to insert it. (2) There's no lock/ click so even when you do insert it, you may not know it is fully in. (3) The cotton filler is also huge. I won't describe what it feels like inside of me but suffice to say it's extremely uncomfortable. (4) The string seem too thin and thus is hard to find when one needs to remove the tampon. (5) They don't seem to last as long as competitors. The pads have issues too. (a) They do not absorb as advertised, which can cause an embarrassing situation. (b) The pads adhesive don't stick, which also causes leaking. I love the idea behind these products - 100% cotton, eco-friendly, women owned.

Nothing changed the outcome. The rest of the tampon will not have hardly any blood on the outside. I've not had this experience with cheaper tampons in the past which have nice thick cotton strings. I wanted so badly for these to work as I want to keep bleach and excess chemicals away from my body, but these work worse than dollar store tampons.

But these are terrible, and I will never repurchase. The applicator is terrible, and as someone who has been using exclusively tampons for years, I am incredibly frustrated by them. I’ve tried many brands and have NEVER had issues when inserting tampons until these. Not to mention the applicator has sharp edges after the product has been applicated which pinch and pull. Further, I’ve NEVER had pain inserting tampons before. Ever. But these are horribly uncomfortable. For some reason (and I am just using the regular size, so they aren’t too large) they are horrible painful to apply and caused me terrible pain for the first hour upon wearing them. I will also mention that they leaked more than other products I’ve used.

On the first day using them the string ripped when I was trying to take it out. I didn’t see it as a big deal at first until I wasn’t able to take it out because of my nails. I had to rush to a small clinic and never felt so humiliated. I was given a pad when I left the clinic. Later that evening I forgot to purchase different tampons so I just put on another Lola. When I removed that one everything was fine and I was thinking I probably had tug the other one too hard. On day 4 of my cycle another Lola tampon string broke again! This time I was so lucky the tampon was in a position where I can take it out.

I have overall had good experiences with the compact plastic applicator tampons but after reading other reviews I realize that I have also leaked within an hour of using a super + which is unheard of for me as I generally have a light flow. I do now wonder if there are truly absorbancy issues there. My biggest issue is that they are much more expensive on Lola's own website than they are if you buy them at a retailer so I will now always buy elsewhere. I also purchased a pack of pregnancy tests during the fall last year which I was hoping to keep on hand if they were needed (no one wants to run to the store during a 911 pregnancy scare) and found that the tests expire just 6 months later.

kal,US,"Sep 21, 2020","I really want to like the tampons and I…I really want to like the tampons and I keep using them because I feel like they are healthier than regular tampons, but I've had issues with them.  Sometimes the cotton part doesn't come out when I fully press the applicator.  About 5-10 percent of the time, I take the applicator out and the tampon comes with it.  I've been using tampons my whole life and I'm almost 40, this is not user error...and I'm not doing anything differently when the tampon does come out.  The second problem is: If my flow isn't heavy and the tampon is not saturated and still a little dry in some areas (fyi, I always use appropriate absorbency but it's not always completely predictable, and sometimes flow can be intermittent), then the cotton rips and small pieces of cotton stay inside of me.  I figure this is not healthy at all and could possibly lead to infection, so I have to get the pieces out, and it's just not something I want to have to do.  Again, I've been using tampons for about 27 years, and I've never had this happen with other tampons.  I should just stop using them, but I keep hoping it will stop happening because I don't want to go back to the toxic kind.Date of experience: September 21, 2020",2

Kaleigh Macha,US,"Sep 28, 2020","Great Organic Tampons!!!So, I bleed horribly bad. We’re talking leaking out of super plus in an hour. It’s not like that my entire cycle but for at least 2-3 days out of 7. The rest of the time it varies between heavy enough for super and regular. With that said, no tampons are fully leak proof for me. But, when my cycle isn’t at its worst, these don’t leak and I feel much better wearing them than pads. I didn’t start using tampons until I was out of school. And I wish I had sooner. High school was miserable using so many pads that I felt like I was wearing a diaper. Those of you heavy bleeders know what I mean. Anyway, sorry for all of the tmi. Just here to say that I love these organic, clean tampons that I get to customize every month. For reference, I usually buy two-three boxes every 4-6 weeks. I buy a ton of super plus, super, and regular.Date of experience: September 28, 2020",5

He asked to apply a sample of the skin care to under my eye, waited a few minutes then presented a mirror to display how much better it looked than the untreated eye.  I said it felt as tho he had applied some sort of glue to make the skin more taught.  He said it would only costy $700.00 for the product and would last for 10 years.  I said I wouldn't last that long as I am 89!He proceeded to show me other products, i.e. skin cream, neck cream and said I could have it all for $189.00 by him using his ""rewards"".

While walking though a museum I needed to use the restroom. When I pull down my pants I noticed a huge spot of blood all over my new Jean shorts. Thank goodness that I was wearing a long shirt. I lock the bathroom door and run cold water over them, then holding them under a dryer. I thought that these were heavy pads? They are also very narrow. Will never buy ever again. Also I noticed brown spots on the pad itself? Me as a very sanitary person was concerned. They didn’t feel very thick which is weird for it saying “heavy flow”.

Joy Shyngle,US,"Oct 10, 2020","The applicator is terribleThe applicator is terrible on the bigger absorbency products, i found myself having to throw tampons away because they wouldn’t come out of the applicator but got bloody on the tip and started to expand-making it even more impossible to get it out of the applicator. Plus the style of applicator easily clamps down on your skin down there, which is painful and ridiculous for how far technology has advanced for tampons and applicator design.

But the applicators suck, like big time.  Like I cannot recall the number of times I would be inserting a tampon and the applicator would falil to applicate, and yeah I would end up having to throw out a perfectly new good tampon , bc it was no longer usable.  I have been meaning to tell yall about this issue, bc I really want my money back for those. but wait there's more! In addition to this fact, I have actually gotten hurt badly twice putting in your tampons before. The plastic part that encloses the applicator and tampon would pinch me (yes down there) as I was inserting the tampon in to use.  I wouldn't even know how bad I was hurt bv there is already blood there, but yes one time the pinch or injury was so bad I was bleeding and I panicked bc it hurt so much and a fold of skin was caught in there and I was literally stuck like that until I figured out what had happened and I had to pull it back out, with my flesh inside between the two pieces of plastic (which also hurt like a mother *** ) and yeah then I saw the new blood.   I actually was in pain for so long after and was so afraid to use a tampon for a really long time after that.

(I just checked out with PayPal fast checkout)  I went out of town and didn’t have service for a week and got the text that they would be charging my card yesterday, I got home this morning and saw the text and the charge once I got service back and emailed as soon as I noticed (8am) because the order wasn’t placed until last night at 11:14pm so I figured I could get it canceled and refunded.They took 7 hours to respond and only did once I called and left a voicemail, saying that there is nothing they can do once the order is placed (even when it hadn’t shipped yet) she then told me to DONATE OR GIFT THEM since I didn’t want them.I asked about returns, but wouldn’t you know it they also don’t accept those either even if the package is completely unopened and is refused. This is the biggest scam and an awful way to treat people, I gave more than enough time to stop the order process and it’s the Friday of a holiday weekend & Monday is the holiday so I know they’re not shipping it until Tuesday. They’re taking advantage of the fact that they sell intimate products and people can’t return them by also not allowing cancelations so if you forget to pause or like me can’t figure out how to access the “account” to cancel your subscription : don’t buy here!!

Pamela Davis,US,"Aug 29, 2022","Poor Business Practices/ProductsI decided to try Lola tampons and pads since they are organic and can be delivered straight to me. God this has been nothing but a headache since day one. So first when I created my account, I got the verification email and verified the account. Then suddenly it wouldn’t let me sign back in. I tried resetting my password and that wouldn’t work so I created another account using a different email address. I placed an order for their pads and subscribed to their “Lola+” subscription. I never once received a shipping confirmation, and the account I was signed in under didn’t show an active subscription or any pending orders.  Upon reaching out to their customer service team (which you can only do my email btw. And you have to submit your info and wait on THEM to contact you) I was met with no response from them. I finally took it upon myself to google their email and email them DIRECTLY and I was informed that the order was placed under the first account I created (which I find odd seeing as how I couldn’t even get signed back into it) and that the “package had already shipped”. The label wasn’t even created until the following Monday, and I reached out to customer service twice before that without hearing back from them. I had to email them myself (after sending in two contact requests already) and I still didn’t hear anything back until the following day. I had also decided to try their tampons (which are sold at Walmart for almost $3 cheaper than if you order them off the Lola website) only to find them COMING APART INSIDE OF ME. What kind of tampon doesn’t use some kind of protective lining or barrier to prevent chunks of cotton from being left behind?? After these issues I requested a refund for the pads I ordered (I refuse to use a product from a company that is knowingly selling their products even though they are not safe and have had MULTIPLE customers tell them so) and a refund for the subscription that I will not be using (because who in their right mind wants to support a company that’s so shady with their products AND prices). They are refusing to refund me my money for the pads I ordered (I even offered to return the entire package unopened still sealed with their factory’s tape) and refusing to refund my money for their subscription. I’m sorry, but if I were you, I would stay far far away from Lola products. Not only are their tampons dangerous, but they’re ripping you off if you use their subscription service.

I haven’t used other products but I appreciate that the company has forayed into all sorts of menstrual care products that address all the miserable aspects of our cycles. I enjoy the convenience of the delivery and flatly telling my husband when he asks what’s my “package du jour” that it’s tampons, haha. However, this isn’t the first time I’ve said this - the design of the tampons themselves can be problematic. Every period, I have no less than 3 tampons not “eject” properly/fully leaving me with no way to insert them properly and having to discard them unused. This is frustrating because Lola tampons are not cheap, I can’t afford to not be able to use what I pay for and if I’m out at a public restroom when this happens, this can go from frustrating to “uh-oh, now what do I do?” in a hurry. Thanks to companies like Lola revolutionizing the industry, there are a lot more organic tampons to choose from now even at Target. For the cost of Lola products, I just wish they were more reliably functional because If I’m being honest, I’ve definitely test-driven other options that have not shown to have this problem. I mean this last period, I went through 3 malfunctioning Lola tampons (and a lot of swearing) in one (toilet) sitting. I can’t be the only person having this problem.

The only portion that is stated organic is the actual cotton tampon. The applicator is plastic and the wrapper is plastic. The applicator also goes in your body. Which is only momentary but I also care about the waste. Seventh gen tampons have a plant based applicator that is as smooth and comfortable as plastic and has a paper wrapper. They are also organic cotton as well. The Lola tampon itself does the job when I’m in a pinch. But they don’t last as long as my usuals.Date of experience: September 11, 2020",2
Jen R.,US,"Sep 10, 2020","UTTER GARBAGE!!!!I bought a small box (8) of the super tampons a couple days ago from Walmart. (I work at Walmart so I was familiar with seeing this brand.) And for like $3, what could possibly go wrong?! A LOT. Luckily, I didn't have the ""disolving"" issues like some of these reviews, but I did have the insertion issues. I'm a plus-size lady who doesn't use tampons all that often, but when I do... I'd damn sure expect them to work properly!! My first attempt was yesterday. As soon as I opened the wrapper & took it out to extend it, it came apart in my hands. So... I had to put my tampon back together. First try at insertion was a literal joke. IT WOULD NOT GO IN. Second try at insertion, and hey, what do you know?! It fell apart. AGAIN! Third try, and it went in. Finally, I thought, success! Until I went to push. I thought I was gonna be hands deep in my lady parts, fishing the whole thing out. The applicator would not push the tampon in. No matter what I did, how hard or soft I pushed on it, what angle I tried. Nothing. Lucky for me, I still had a couple of my Tampax Pocket Radiant tampons left and used those (and I was smart to buy a big box of pads when I bought these s**t Lola tampons!!)

Unfortunately, the flood gates to hell opened up two days prior. I found these organic pads and I was super excited to try them.I bought this new, beautiful pant suit/jumpsuit thingie (I dressed way out of my comfort zone and was nervous enough already). So, I am in our hotel room, with an hour to go till our reservation. Sitting on the toilet, I insert the tampon but the inner-tube wouldn't push in. After struggling for a bit, my vagina decided she had enough of that and dislodged the tampon. I grab #2; insert it, same issue. Using my right hand to hold the tampon still, I use my left hand to try to push the inner-tube in. After fighting it for a while, it SLOWLY pushes the tampon up. I pull the inner-tube and it won't come down.... It won't release the tampon. While, blindly pulling away, I ended up giving myself an ""interesting haircut"". After getting hot and shaking from frustration, I lean against to toilet to relax and breath for a moment. I try to pull it again, same bull crap. My hands are a bloody fricking mess at this point. I yank it out, wrap it up and throw it as vigorously as I can, into the trash. Tampon number 3 on the way.... Everything goes smoothly. The inner-tube pushes up and actually pulls back out. I was so happy!!! Until... It didn't release the tampon AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Everything came out!  After 3, I gave up. Luckily I had some night-time pads I could substitute with.

But not Lola for some reason.  Appears to be an ongoing issue with other reviewers here.  The first time it happened, I foolishly assumed it was a one-off bad-batch, a hazard of tampons in general since they all come with TSS warnings.

I'm a heavy bleeder on my period and the pads they sent were basically a glorified panty liner. It appealed to me that it was made out 100% cotton but also it was like $30 a month  for not high quality pads that didn't even last me the end of period which lasts for about 5 days. I gave them 2 stars instead of just 1 because the delivery always came on time and it was super easy to cancel my subscription. But it also worries me that it's actually super hard to leave any sort of review. I visited their website to leave a review multiple times and their Facebook page and it still wouldn't let me leave a review which I feel is sketch. I have not tried any of their sexual health stuff such as their lube and condoms but last I looked it was very expensive and I was better off just getting KY jelly at the super market.

Kalli Corbin,US,"Jul 27, 2020","I bought some Lolas at WalmartI bought some Lolas at Walmart. I thought I’d try something more “pure” since they say that’s better. Anyway the thing is, is that I feel like I bleed right through the center and I have to change it because I’m leaking. When I’ve removed them the outside layers are still in used. It just made a straight shot through the middle, ( if that makes sense) I just think what’s the point. I might as well be using pads. 🤦🏻‍♀️Date of experience: July 27, 2020",2

I understand that if you want an organic product with no chemicals you have to expect it might not work the same as a large brand name unorganic product but I just don't have time to change my tampon every 1 or 2 hours when I can get another brand and not have to change it nearly as often.

Samantha Rivea,US,"Updated Jul 14, 2020","Don’t trust the advertising— SO DISAPPOINTING!!If I could rate this product zero stars I would. I have never been more disappointed in a feminine product ever. I have always wanted to try Lola because of it’s supposedly natural ingredients and also because of how it’s all organic material and it being cotton, etc. When I saw that Walmart carried Lola I was so excited and bought a box of tampons and pads, which wasn’t cheap, but bought them anyway because I’ve been wanting to try the brand for so long. First time I used the tampon, I can already tell I wasn’t going to like it. The applicator sucks. It doesn’t even help push the tampon in all the way before it falling apart. I tried it two more times after that to see if maybe I was just doing it wrong, but nope. Total fail for the tampon so I stopped using it. When I tried using the pads, as soon as I opened one I was immediately disgusted. I found like black spots of like dirt? And I also found a hair? Of the box of six pads, I opened all of them and every single one of them had something on it. There isn’t supposed to be anything on them!!! How are we supposed to wear them when they seem dirty?! How do they go through and pass inspection before distribution? It’s just so unacceptable. We’re supposed to feel good with products we know are safe to use but after this I not using Lola products again. I am just so appalled and disappointed in these products and from what I can see I’m not the only one who’s had problems. I’ll be going back to using Always brand. At least their products are clean and easy to use.Date of experience: July 14, 2020",1

I also don’t like that when you seem to push it all the way up it’s not all the way in and then you kind pull the tampon down as your trying to remove the applicator. i noticed fibers on the pointy parts which scares me because i don’t want cotton fibers left in my sensitive areas, wanted to like it but all around terrifying product.Date of experience: July 12, 2020",1

Angela Baker,US,"Updated Jun 23, 2020","Annoying applicatorEvery answer to a negative review, is a cookie-cutter response from Raven at the company. Why even bother responding if you're going to just repeat word for word what you said to another review?  I was extremely upset with these tampons. First I was excited to find Super plus 100% cotton tampons at Walmart. I usually use Seventh Generation and love them. But this Walmart didn't have them. So I resigned to try Lola. I wasn't happy with the compact applicator but it was the only kind available. It isn't user friendly. The inner part comes all the way out and falls separate from the outer part if you're not careful. Plus after I've supposedly pushed the tampon all the way out of the applicator, the tampon still isn't free from the applicator. Am I explaining it clearly? Its hard to explain. But next time, I'll be searching for another brand.Date of experience: June 23, 2020",2

Katy Erickson,US,"Jun 17, 2020","I really wanted to love Lola Tampons…I really wanted to love Lola Tampons because they are 100% cotton, better for my body, etc., so I tried them for a second time thinking I just got the wrong size tampon. Both cycles using their tampons I leaked about 30-40 minutes after putting a new tampon in. When I removed it, the tampon had barely absorbed anything and did not expand like other brands. Additionally, I wouldn’t recommend doing any light or rigorous exercise while wearing their tampons unless you want major leakage.  If they were to improve their tampons by making them more absorbent, expand while inside, or maybe ones for exercising, I would consider using Lola brand again.Date of experience: June 17, 2020",2

The string feels like it’s going to rip when you pull it out because it is very thin and leaks very easily. Most tampons are supposed expand but these do not and I have to change them every 2-4 hours when I normally don’t change my other brand until 6-8 hours. They’re comfortable but I don’t like the feeling that I’m bleeding through it. The applicator is the worst, it’s very uncomfortable to put it in and the cotton will stick to it sometimes making me believe it sheds as well.Date of experience: May 27, 2020",1

I don’t have a subscription, actually I never heard of them til I saw their promotion at Walmart. Was wanting to try organic natural cotton feminine  products and it was a decent price, so I got some liners, tampons, and a sample of pads. Really happy I did. They don’t sting or bother me, and although not super observant etc like U by Kotex, still leak free. I’m sensitive in my vagina too, have to use natural dye-free balancing vaginal wash just to do normal outside cleanings in the shower of my vagina, and I noticed I’d feel yeast infections coming on a lot when getting off my periods or a burning like feeling with normal tampons or pads. Not these. I think I’m sensitive to some of the dyes in normal ones, because with these I had no feelings of stinging or burning. So glad I switched and will keep buying organic cotton from here on. A great plus is they’re biodegradable too, so I don’t feel guilty about filling up the land fields either. Love these!Date of experience: May 27, 2020",5

However, when you get an e-mail 4 days after your order was expected saying they aren't coming on time (and you have it set up so they arrive in time for your monthly cycle, which doesn't just stop because some company messed up), any positives of this service become null and void. It also doesn't help that they sent an e-mail telling me the extra stuff I have to do to get them earlier. I'm sorry, what is the point of a subscription then?
