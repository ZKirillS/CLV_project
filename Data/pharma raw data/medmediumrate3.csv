Dean,CA,Updated 3 days ago,"DON'T use UNIUNI to deliver you packages !!!It wasn't the fact that it took them a week to ship my order that I only left them a 1 star review.  It was the fact that they used UNIUNI to deliver me my package.  This is the worst delivery company on the planet.  They told me yesterday that I would receive my package at 10:12 am.  I waited until midnight for it to arrive only to wake up the next day to find out my package had been delivered at 8:16 am to my apartment building and left on the stairs in the back stairwell (where tenants have had packages stolen in the past) instead of to my apartment door like every other delivery company.

When buying off the internet please pay with a credit card as you have a bunch of protections if a company ghosts you and doesn’t send you the products out. Always use a credit card. Always make sure you read Trustpilot reviews before you buy, I wouldn’t recommend any company with a 1-3 rating to order from.

Rebecca,US,"Updated Nov 26, 2024Verified","Update - a good company, took great care shipping, been challenging to return but is getting sorted out, seller certainly responsive!I wanted a different product, and have been asking to return what I was sent and I have been *unable* to receive the information for a return. I've asked multiple times and have been ghosted by the company at this point. I was very optimistic and loved the care they took in sending the order but would sadly not advise anyone to order from HerbsPro given the seemingly false advertising when it comes to 'no questions asked' returns. A bummer, seems like a good company but buyer beware, we are now stuck with our order and out the money it seems.Updated- I’ve sent the return in but it seems from this message that the seller has not received it. I appreciated the response and ability to return. Seems like a fine company, would’ve been great, packaged really nicely, just not the product we’d wanted. Not the company’s fault and again I have indeed returned the shipment via usps and the return label, so not my fault either for the delay. Really hoping this puts an end to this. Am certain that others would have a wonderful experience, they took great care shipping. I have simply had a more frustrating and less than delightful experience. I’m sure it is just my own situation. They have certainly responded to the return. Hoping usps gets it to them shortly. Thanks. Date of experience: November 18, 2024",3

RB,US,"Nov 13, 2024","Wrong product received, and will not get full refundI ordered Every Man Jack GROOMING Beard Balm. I received Every Man Jack STYLE Beard Balm. I advised customer support that the wrong product was shipped. The containers are very similar, even the stocker pulled the wrong type.  I opened the container and instantly knew it was not correct. I emailed support and received a reply from Alejandra O...  I was advised that they will not allow the opened incorrect product to be shipped back.  I previously used the product they shipped, and I do not want it, and I did not order it. I could have ordered the STYLE beard balm from other places at a lower price, but I chose to pay more for the GROOMING beard balm from HerbsPro. Ultimately, I will not get reimbursed for the shipping charges nor the opened container I do not want.  Not the level of customer service I expected. They did provide a return label for the unopened container. We will see how the return goes.  Date of experience: November 12, 2024",1

It's now 10-11 and the only emails this company is sending out is a barrage of marketing emails several times a day, every day and can't even as a courtesy provide proper order updates unless I keep calling and get a different answer.

If I would have been informed that this was the issue, I would have waited and not been this frustrated. Please communicate with your customers when they send you emails. Thank you. I will change my rating to a positive one now that I have an explanation of what to expect. Update: A few hours after I wrote this review, the company shipped one of three bottles. Although I am glad I finally have one bottle on the way, I am still in limbo with the other part of my order and refund for the two bottles that did not ship. When will I receive my refund for the two out of stock unshipped items? This is where email updates would be very useful to the customer.Where do I begin with this horrible experience? I ordered 3 bottles of a vitamin supplement they said they had in stock. It said the item (s) would ship the same day. Days go by, I never receive any sort of shipping confirmation. I email them. I don't hear back. It took one email per day for 4 days to even get one response back. When I finally heard back, the person told me to be patient and wait 1 to 2 more days for shipping. I wait 3 days. I contact them again. They email me back and tell me to wait 1 to 2 more business days again. I wait. I contact them again inquiring about my package and why it hasn't shipped after two weeks.  I go back on their website and notice how they switched it to out of stock. So, I email them telling them to refund me. They ignore my emails. I have no refund. This product is completely discontinued and will never be in stock again. I told them if I didn't hear back from them and receive my refund of $60+ , I would file a report on reportfraud.ftc.gov. I have read too many comments on this website and multiple other review sites where this company doesn't have a product in stock, they ignore emails and do not refund the money or take entirely too long to do so. I check my spam folder every day, and they have yet to respond to me about my unshipped products and refund of my own money. This is very unprofessional. A little communication would go a long way to keep the customer updated on what is actually happening with their order, instead of continually telling customer to wait 1 to 2 more days.  I have gotten the run around for over 2 weeks now. I want my money back. Date of experience: September 29, 2024",5
