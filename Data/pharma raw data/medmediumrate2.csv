Shannon B,US,"Feb 21, 2024Verified","Good products but price gouging is a problemI like the company's products but I am not a fan of their practices. Their promos really aren't promos, as they cancel out free shipping which is otherwise quite expensive. Any coupons offered for a future purchase end within a time frame that would have the customer buying earlier than needed so are rendered basically useless. The products are on the pricey side to begin with. If I buy, I tend to buy elsewhere so I don't get gouged for shipping, but honestly I've replaced most of the Native Remedies products I use with other things due to their practices.Date of experience: January 07, 2024",3

I stopped coughing but I still had lots of mucus in my bronchial so I started looking for a natural remedy to get rid of it. I found Mucus-Clear and decided to give it a try.

My son hasn't been diagnosed with Adhd, but he does have trouble focusing sometimes and just staying on task. He's a talker and at times gets easily distracted. He is 9 and he's just a kid so some of that is to be expected. These little pills have calmed him and changed everything.  He's making honor roll because he's focusing and finishing all of his work. His behavior is better and he can tell when he's missed a dose. He asks for his little ""vitamins"". Everything is just different in the best way. If your child sounds like mine, try it!

My review is on the Sinu-rite and the Aggression Formula.  Listening to her breathing, I don't feel she is suffering from a snoring sound when she breaths during sleep. Also, at first on the aggression I would have said it hasn't helped at all as she is very jealous of attention given to our other dog, but lately there are some days we have noticed that she doesn't come running at us barking and pushing her way at us so we give her the attention instead. Yesterday she just sat on my lap and let me pet our other dog and show love to her without barking and carrying on like she would have done before.  We have only been giving it to her two times a day. She will have to continue doing that and not getting so worked up barking so crazy when we have storms and chasing the cats everytime she sees one walk across the floor before we would continue paying $36.00+/- every month for it as we are also suffering from the cost of living problems too.

LISA B,US,"Updated Mar 3, 2024Verified","Pancreas Support…I started using Pancreas Support capsules for my 18yo cat about 1 yr ago. It has helped her significantly. She is now able to snack periodically throughout the day and at night when I am sleeping, although her diet is drastically different in addition to the supplements. My cat gets 1/3 of a capsule of Pancreas Support every night like clockwork just before bedtime and paired with another product(catalase). She is so, so much better. There is no longer any vomiting or diarrhea, unless she finds an odd piece of some random food/plant bits on the floor. She is now social and talkative. It is nice to see her enjoying her days so much more.We are so thankful for this supplement. My fur baby doesn't have diabetes, but needs a boost to help her with making enzymes(too much dry cat food in the past). Great supplement!! I don't think my furbaby would be here without it.Through trial and error I have found if the dose is too strong for my girl she gets very soft stool and will throw up anything she has eaten. This happens approximately 2hrs after the dosage is given. This formula does work in the right dosage. I am thankful for this product. Oh, gave it only 4 stars since I have to resize the capsule myself. I made my own size3 capsules. By giving her the capsules I know she gets all of the supplement. I know add it to the food says Native Remedies.Date of experience: November 23, 2023",4
Kristi,US,"Feb 23, 2023Verified","Long Time Listener, First Time Caller...I am not a new customer to Native Remedies, but it has been a while since I shopped here.I recently purchased a few items for ADHD and Focus.- The Products:  One of the great things about Native Remedies is that they have products that are natural - and work.  Within 2 weeks of taking the items I bought, I already noticed a HUGE difference in not only focus, but energy!  I had almost no energy before starting and actually didn't even think it was going to give me energy, but I am glad it did!  For the first time in a long time I was able to write down ""goals"" for the day and actually complete all 10 goals lol.  - Taste:  If you've never had a product like this or Bach's Flower Remedies you might be weirded out by the taste.  It's not horrible or gross, it's just different.  I like mine with a little water, I ensure it's done sublingually (under the tongue) and I do what the directions tell me to do.- Shipping:  I got these super quick!

Marie Suhl,US,"Mar 24, 2022Verified","Mostly Good.For the first time in her life my senior fur baby Daisy was afflicted with allergies that started in the fall. Severe nasal congestion, sneezing, coughing, and the all dreaded reverse sneeze. Daisy had a rhinoscopy which thankfully showed no illness or growth was the cause. But that left us with no plan of definative action, so for months now my vet and I are trying different treatments consisting of both pharmaceutical and holistic treatments, as well as reducing any possible environmental triggers, which means I have to deep clean my house every two weeks (using just vinegar and no harsh chemicals). Nothing so far has been able to clear her congestion and combat the allergens allowing her to breath easily. I have tried using the sinus and respiratory meds from Native Remedies for 36 days now, and although they have not cleared the congestion the combined meds help keep the sinus from getting an infection which could easily progress to the lungs. The only negative I have is that these are expensive products and at a max dose there is only an 18 day supply per bottle and it's not always in stock. Treatment for a symptom that you don't know the cause for can take months or years and when combined with other treatments it's hard to determine actual benefits. I don't know if this product would be economically feasible for long-term use.Date of experience: March 24, 2022",4

Does not work!Not only did it not help with joint pain, it upset my stomach so badly I could not continue to take it. I've never had a legitimate herbal remedy do that! They are refusing to pay for a shipping label to mail it back to them. I should not have to pay to return a product that does not do anything close to what it claims to. I am 70, disabled and don't drive. I don't own a car or printer and can't go to a store to return it due to being at high risk from Covid.

Irene Pellegrino,US,"Mar 4, 2022Verified","Great Products, User Friendly Website, Ease of OrderingI have ordered various remedies from Native Remedies over the years, and have recently, within the last couple of years, ordered from them again. At present, I am enjoying the Elderberry Immune Support syrup which I have ordered two or three times during these past months. Delivery of their products has always been timely; the products are a bit pricey, but I believe they have all been of supreme quality. I have ordered products for my pets, also, and have had the same great customer service as relates to ordering, paying and timely delivery. I am constantly recommending Native Remedies to my friends and will continue to do so.Date of experience: March 04, 2022",5

Michele Ogburn,US,"Feb 27, 2022Verified","Relief Finally!When I first started taking these drops, it seemed to work immediately. Then I found that a few days later it became a dependency, using it everyday. That might be because I caught a slight cold during this time too.  Henceforth, it's been about a month now and I find that my condition has improved.  I don't get the post nasal drip as often, I don't have to cough as much now, and I really don't have that ""frog in the throat"" in the morning anymore. I purchased both the day and night drops.  I guess it takes time to work like everything else.  I can feel a difference since using this stuff, it makes life more enjoyable!Date of experience: February 27, 2022",4

The products I've tried are top quality and do the job. The N-con Tonic is a winner for me. I'm 63 yrs young and I love to drink water, my bladder doesn't hold as much as it use to. So, I chew 2 tiny pills in the morning and 2 in the evening maybe 2  days a week and it works wonders!!! I've also take the verti free for vertigo and it clears it up after 4 or 5 times(2 pills at a time) when the vertigo hits. Oh and I love the spray for sleep/relaxation!! It is the Best!!
