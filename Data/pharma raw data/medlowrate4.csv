Denise Leite-Alves,US,"Oct 22, 2024","Horrible serviceWhen I called, I was so excited to find something that would ""solve"" my problem, that apparently, I didn't hear that I would be charged $499 just for a urine test and that I would have to pay another $495 for the consultation.

Delicia McCullough,US,"Oct 15, 2024","Horrible Customer ServiceI inquired about services at BodyLogic online and received a phone call. However, the representative was extremely unprofessional and failed to listen to my concerns. Instead, she did not allow me to finish my statement and proceeded to talk over me. I wish I remembered her name, but whoever called me from the Atlanta location (from phone number 404-602-0376) on Tuesday 10/15/24 @ 1:14pm is a horrible representation of BodyLogicMD Atlanta, and I would not recommend anyone to use this company.Date of experience: October 15, 2024",1
Stormy,US,"Updated Aug 22, 2024","Body Logic Franchise - Inflated PricingWhile I really like the Dr. I use, this review is for the larger machine (aka franchise - Body Logic which he works under). After being a loyal client for almost 2 years, Body Logic tacked on a $300 administrative fee with zero warning or notification. When you sign up with this company and take hormones, you are automatically committing to routine blood tests amongst other tests.  This is normal as they should be checking your serum levels routinely when you take hormones. However, now in addition to their already crazy high lab fees and urine test kits that I pay for out of pocket, Body Logic has decided to add on a $300 admin fee as well. It's ridiculous - I was warned about this place by other reviews that has similar comments and now it's happening to me. It's sad because I like my Dr that works under them very much, but I am very turned off by the larger functioning body logic franchise machine that you have to work through and their crazy prices and hidden fee's. I don't feel like a valued client to them even though I feel cared for by the Dr. in my area that represents them. It's also a bit confusing to get a hold of the right people since you are working through the franchise for some of the experience like lab work etc., Sadly, with these new admin fee add ons will be taking my business elsewhere. There are a plethora of hormone companies out there now. Do your research! Date of experience: August 19, 2024",2
Catherine Hankerson,US,"Updated Jul 14, 2021Invited","Disappointed in Lack of ServiceMy phone calls were recorded for response but never heard from Body Logic. My entire medication order was taken off auto ship when I requested that only one be removed. Finally, after repeated calls someone straightened out my account. This is not competent management. If I could purchase my particular medications elsewhere I would waste no time in doing so. Also, please give your telephone employees some telephone skill training, some sound like they were just awakened from a nap!Date of experience: July 14, 2021",2
Ala Web,US,"Jul 16, 2021Invited","After three months not much differenceAfter three months, I don't see much difference in feeling better yet.

Fortunately I found a similar bio identical service for a smaller price, same labs, SAME PHARMACY and same treatment with zero hidden fees.  When my old doctor left (without notice by this company), I was defaulted to the other doctor in the practice. Somehow my fees went up by about $100 for a FOLLOW UP, not even a full visit.

All of the departments and income streams firmly in place just waiting for the cattle, I mean patients, to be pushed through. If you are looking for ""care"", I would go elsewhere.  Dr. Okereke is knowledgeable, but rushed.  I did not feel like a human being who was listened to; just a set of labs with a credit card.  One time I was trying to explain a bad reaction to a supplement and I was yelled at and told I had to stay on them.  I was taking 29 pills/day, injections and creams and yet my numbers and symptoms were going in the wrong direction...and each time, was prescribed more.  I had to call, email and ask multiple times to get administrative work or medical questions answered.  I have given them nearly a year, and a WHOLE LOT of money, and am in the same/worse shape than I started.  Please, learn from my bad judgement and over-extended optimism.

I’ve been going to them for about 10 years and am very happy that I found them. I went into menopause fast at the younger age of the spectrum and experienced  every bad side affect. After much research, reading various books, It was suggested I go to women’shealth.org and put in hormone replacement. I was very nervous and skeptical at first but jumped in and have never looked back. I initially thought it was a placebo but stopped treatment for about a year and was miserable. I couldn’t wait to start up the hormones and supplements again. I truly believe Dr. Ohri is one of the smartest and thorough Drs. I have ever met and she has truly improved every aspect of my life. Everyone I have dealt with has been a pleasure and I highly recommend BodyLogic MD to anyone who is even remotely thinking about taking that leap.

Since the new system, I have so many problems, have to call in endlessly, and still after all that time and effort my orders are still a mess. I no longer get reminders. My order in split into multiple separate orders and I get charged $10 for each one that is under $100, even though they ship on the same day to the same address. No one is able to change it into one order, not the doctor's room, not the call center. I am unable to change anything about the order or put just one supplements on hold, I have to call in for everything. I have no idea what the prices are. No longer do I get paperwork in my orders, they arrive with nothing. A supplement in a box, that's it. No where online is there a price.

I started with auto orders but quickly turned them off when I realized I couldn't change a date for one without changing them all.  I have managed my reorders by calling them in at least two weeks before needed, and over and over I've been frustrated with the time it takes to receive them.  I thought the new patient portal would help, but it changed nothing.  I can't track my orders.  I've had an order randomly cancelled and only realized it when I called customer service.  I have one supplement on backorder right now (7/14) that I ordered on 6/3 and ran out of around 7/1.  I've heard every reason from the FedEx shooting in Indianapolis to increased demand on the compounding pharmacies.  I pay a lot of money for this treatment and the supplements and am becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the ordering process.  I do have to say that the customer service reps help me as much as they can, and I hate to keep complaining to them because I know they have no control over the problems.  Lastly, I sit on hold for several minutes each time I call.

First of all, I see Dr. Archer, I really like her, she's sweet, listens to you and seems knowledgable and that is the only reason I didn't give it a one-star.  As for the company ""body-logic"" at every turn I have had a bad experience.  The communication is horrible, everything is micro-managed and I do not believe anyone knows what anyone else is doing or what is going on.  I was told at the first contact for this ""balance-pro program"" that it was a flat fee every 2 months and that everything was covered (labs, meds, MD fee) come to find out that the only meds that are ""covered"" by this ""plan"" is testoterone (and testosterone is cheap) so if you need any other hormone balancing meds (which I needed all of them and thyroid meds) they are not covered.  I find this out only after talking to 4 different people because no one either didn't know or wouldn't give me a straight answer.  You cannot find any written information on the website as to what this $600 actually provides you.  when I asked someone who works there why I cannot find any of the information or have not received any information in writing, I get no answer and they change the subject.  The Pharmacy side isn't any better, in my opinion, first of all it takes 7-10days to get to me (no I do not live in outer mongolia) and I have had to frequently call to see where my meds are, if they've even been shipped yet.  No apologies on that, by the way, just a ""oh, they should be shipping out today"" response.  I feel like every communication with them has been less than honest.

I called discussed my medical concerns with Dr. Mazzei (durning the heat of  covid) and let me tell you… I felt some relief.   I was not going to get my hopes up but they sent the hormone testing to my home and in 2 weeks I had consult with the doctor.

Concerned for others,US,"Jul 16, 2021Invited","Troubled by care providedI don't normally write reviews but I feel compelled to do so today. I have had a difficult journey working with BodyLogicMD. I have been working with them for over a year and have had little to no improvement. As it turns out, my last labs are now showing a decline in overall health. I thought when I started working with them I was going to get individualized treatment but It feels like a ""canned program"" instead of addressing actual individual concerns. At each visit the doctor had already decided what she is going to do next with my treatment, even before she had heard how I was doing on the last adjustments. It is hard to reach the doctor to ask questions, office staff are not easy to work with and astronomical fees are charged to get the required lab slips. They don't submit to insurance and require you to use only one pharmacy that charges on the higher side. At each visit I would explain my concerns and symptoms and receive a preplanned/prepared adjustment. When I would try to reach out to let the doctor know things were not going well between visits, I was met with the same thing....stay on track and we'll do lab work in 3 months and go from there. I am now at the point that my lab work is troublesome and I'm being recommended to go see my PCP so they can help correct my declining lab results. I thought BodyLogicMD was the specialist in this area? Very mixed messages are now taking place. At my last visit progress was praised in certain areas of my treatment in the beginning of the conversation and by the end was I being suggested to wean off everything, even the very things that were praised as doing well. I'm left questioning whether there is any expertise here. Even though I have done everything the doctor asked me to do over the past year, I feel now they are trying to get rid of me as a patient because the canned program isn't working for me? I'm so disappointed and frustrated. Have I just wasted a year and hundreds of dollars? I now have to start all over in a worse place then when I started with BodyLogicMD. I would not recommend them.Date of experience: July 16, 2021",1

Lauren Bryant,US,"Sep 16, 2021","This company is a SCAMThis company is a SCAMThe at-home testing kit was incredibly inefficient. I had to send two different blood samples in, which I performed exactly to the instructions, only to be told twice that the cotton swabs did not have enough blood on them. I then had to go to a lab to have blood drawn so that their sample would be large enough.The company is also the equivalent of joining a gym membership that is impossible to cancel. They charged me a $600 flat fee which was supposed to include two virtual physician visits, an assessment of my blood/urine, and supplements. As it turned out, the supplements (besides the testosterone) cost extra - I was convinced that I should do a 14-day cleanse consisting of a $170 protein shake pack (surprise, there is no smaller/less expensive cleanse or brand that they offer), as well as other supplements which were not covered (no reason was given for this).I ordered all of the suggested supplements and adhered to the cleanse as best I could. I was specifically told that I would not be charged again without my consent. Yet Bodylogic did charge my credit card again $600 without any email or correspondence or notification whatsoever. When I discovered the charge, I advised Bodylogic that I did not want to continue paying $600 particularly since they had already collected samples from me and the supplements were extra. I also called my credit card company to have the fraudulent charge removed.When my credit card company contacted Bodylogic, the company outright lied to the credit card company and told them that it was not a recurring charge and that I had agreed to the charge. I have been stuck in an endless loop with Bodylogic and Chase trying to get the fraudulent $600 removed from my card, for which I have not received ANY services. Bottom line: do NOT use this company, they are a scam and will charge you exorbitant fees without your permission.Date of experience: September 16, 2021",1

Sasha Jade,US,"Jul 16, 2021","If you are looking for a scam, this is it.If you are looking to add more stress to your life, and be scammed instantly with money withdrawn from your bank account in mere seconds, then this is the place for you. My first contact was with Sabrina Felix, who is slick as heck, continuously using words like “becoming part of the ‘family’” and that they want a 2 month commitment from you- not telling you that $700 would be taken out as soon as you hang up. I was livid and called so many times until I was finally told that “if I were to do all the labs separately and come in and see the doc in office, it would be cost way more.” I received my testing kit and was recommended a HRT plan. Two days ago I had a follow up which lasted about 15 minutes or so, and no sooner than 5 minutes after my follow up, $800 dollars was IMMEDIATELY withdrawn! I’ve been calling and emailing constantly- and getting transferred from one person to another and NOT ONE OF THEM could give me a breakdown of what the money was for, other than “that is the cost of the program you are on, and if labs were needed, it would be covered” which is EXACTLY what I was told the first time they took money out. I told them that my telehealth appointment was 15 minutes at best, and THERE ARE NO LABS needed to be done- so what is the breakdown of the charges?!” NOT ONE person could give me an answer except for the words “program” and “I’m not sure, I don’t work in that department.” So this morning I find a pending refund of $100! I call, and again the same thing- “ I don’t know what’s going on, I will let the supervisor know.” I am BEYOND angry, and beyond broke- and still left hanging with zero clue as to what the money is for. I didn’t do any additional testing, nor was it brought up…I also never heard ANYTHING regarding the withdrawal of $800 dollars- NONE OF THAT WAS talked about before my follow up appointment. I’m still waiting for a call, which I’m sure will not happen anytime soon…in the meantime, consider this a warning- save yourself all of this EXTRA stress, and a drained bank account by looking elsewhere….this place is a SCAM. Period. There is nothing “transparent” about this place as stated on their website; consider yourself warned and now educated- stay as far away from here as possible.Date of experience: July 16, 2021",2

All my questions are always answered. As for the department that ships the supplements I give them a big FAT ZERO. The boxes that the daily supplement packets are in are NOT shipping boxes! They are a box for home use with the packets.....My box for June was shipped FedEx and when I received the box the shrink wrap was opened and the contents were gone and, replaced with a dirty 1/2 bottle of ibuprofen and the box was taped back up! I have a huge issue with this as they print my full name on every packet that would be 60 packets. So who ever stole the supplements has my full name and address. I would think printing a name would be a HIPPA violation. I asked to have the person in charge of that department to call me on 2 different occasions...I never heard from him! I did speak to someone in that office, and I explained my concerns, that I did NOT want my name on the packets anymore and that the supplements need to be shipped in a shipping box, it's common sense!! I just received another box 2 days ago and NOTHING has changed! It was shipped the same way, my name is on all the packets!!! NOT HAPPY! Obviously no one took me seriously or my concerns! My identity could be stolen because of the way you ship things. If this should happen my attorney will be in touch with your company! Your shipping manager should have called me but obviously chose NOT to. I know for a fact he was aware of my situation because, when I went to see Dr. Santana I took the box I had received with me, pictures were taken and sent to the medical director while I was standing there. I also previously had sent pictures 2 days before! I recommend the company revaluate the shipping method as well as printing patients names on the packets. I also recommend you retrain the shipping manager as far as his customer service skills are concerned, he has NONE!Date of experience: July 14, 2021",5

Amy Spencer,US,"Updated Dec 12, 2021","2 Month Update! Life is beautiful!I initially posted a review on October 19, 2021. It was a 3 star because there were positive AND negative things to share. So I did 3 stars for neutral.I must share my experience, up to now, not quite 2 months into my hormone replacement. To truly understand my incredible experience, you must know just how bad things were for me.I went through menopause early and for 10 years… same BS from my GYN… estrogen doses so low that I had no real benefit but my husband could penetrate me without searing pain and bleeding. But it still hurt and there has been no sexual pleasure, at all… for me. JUST pain, followed by many days of burning skin, frequent UTI and kidney infections (which I’ve never suffered from prior to menopause). And my GYN (a female) told me that this is the way it is now… accept it. She had added Testosterone at one point which made it possible to very rarely have a little positive sensation, which ultimately fell flat. Then there was the constant urinary leaking during the day and having to wake up several times every night. She wanted to refer me to a urologist, you know… maybe I need some medication or surgery! She retired and my next GYN, a man… actually listened to me and agreed that it’s not ok to have to engage in something that is painful, causes infections and resentment… and provides NOTHING positive… and it isn’t acceptable. He increased my doses. Still… minimal results. They generally won’t prescribe enough for real results because of CDC guidelines. It was a decade of deep frustration and sadness. Research, over the years led me to finally try Body Logic MD, of FL. It’s not even been 2 months and the difference is incredible. So… this is what I’ve noticed, so far. I asked my husband to leave sex OFF the table, for ONE full week on my new doses.Day 7… Sex did NOT hurt! It didn’t feel good but it didn’t hurt! I held my breath, waiting for the signs of a UTI/Kidney infection. By the end of week two, I exhaled. Nothing! By this point, I was already sleeping better as I was not waking up AT ALL, during the night, to use the bathroom. I can’t tell you how wonderful it is to wake up refreshed. When I am awake, I do still have to pee frequently but I don’t pee my pants if I can’t get to the bathroom right away! Almost 2 months now and still NO infections, sex is more regular and since it isn’t painful, I don’t feel resentful. I now even have SOME pleasure!My skin is soft again! Im not itchy all over, any more! I just had my second virtual appointment a few days ago, with Ms Lupinski and we discussed increasing my doses. YES! She said my estrogen receptors are waking up and the new doses will wake more of them up. So, my Estrogen, Progesterone and Testosterone have been increased and I think it’s going to be enough to achieve the results I seek. And the cost has not increased. Ladies, I highly recommend Body Logic MD of FL. I warn you, the Testosterone is injectable BUT… it’s EASY and it’s NOT painful!Body Logic MD has changed my life, drastically, in such a short time and my marriage, which was very healthy (though we struggled with the menopausal impact on physical intimacy) is experiencing a new excitement and joy! Thank you Body Logic MD! Thank you Christine Lupinski (my wonderful PA)!Date of experience: December 11, 2021",5

Jimmy Pilgrim,US,"Updated Aug 4, 2021Invited","Company has changed for the worst!!!!This is my latest assessment of BodyLogic. The new program they have is terrible to access and have found that the new program over ride the old auto orders. I had orders placed on hold but still received and cannot use at this time, this was due to new system being used. WE did not receive any notice to a new system being put in place to verify orders. ($300.00.) I contacted them with no help on correcting the charges. I have been a part of this company for 15 years and am very disturbed the company is willing to loose my business. I will be looking for a new provider of services.  At this rate Bodylogic will not be in business  The following was directed to the office I use. The  Staff is very professional. The products offered are good if you can get them when scheduled. The bio-identical hormone replacement has changed our lives in everything we do and truly hate to have to look for a different provider.  The company does not and will not ever concede they are wrong and correct issues even if it means losing clients. Very Sad!

Good health is the foundation of a life that can be enjoyed. Dr. Okereke provides specific recommendations to improve your wellness using your own lab reports. Unlike your other doctors that always have their shoulders turned towards the door, she spends time explaining the lab results, what they mean to your health, and how those numbers can be improved to be the best you.  You are no longer guessing on whether you have the correct diet or supplementation because her recommendations are based upon your biochemistry and not some average USDA recommended daily allowance. Her five pillars of good health are nutrition, detoxification, exercise, hormone balance, and stress reduction & sleep.  If you want to enjoy your life, then you need mental clarity, and energy that lasts throughout the day and energy to be intimate with your partner.  Of course, you didn't get to your current health overnight and her guidance will not change your life overnight either, but if you follow her recommendations, then your age will become a number.  I am in the best shape of my life at age 52 with energy, mental sharpness, and vigor that I never experienced before.  If you want to the best you, then you need Dr. Okereke to guide you on a health journey that is unique to you.  Your health is greatest investment you'll ever make.

I now have 3 bottles of each. By the time that I finish the Omega pills, they will be stuck together and I will have to throw them out again. They said they have to send them every 30 days because the doctor wrote the prescription that way. I have asked Dr. Negrin to change the prescription twice.  Customer service said that they will send me a label to return that last order of Calcium and Omega. I haven't received that yet. I finally decided to remove the supplements so I won't get anymore until I need them. Hopefully, it won't be hard to renew the prescription in 3 months when I need them again. I get too many emails. I am unsubscribing to them, but they frequently ignore that. I miss the updating email from BodyLogicMD. I have automated many functions so I don't have to monitor everything. Auto Billpay.
