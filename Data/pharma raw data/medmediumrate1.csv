I have been ordering from them for several years and have been very pleased with what I order for how I use the food (mostly maintenance and occasional weight loss tune up). My last order was not what I have come to expect. My order was two days late and no longer frozen but still cold. I'm not sure if this is the reason that now when I cook the chicken sticks while they are normally plump and moist this batch seems dry and stiff. I will still eat them because like cold pizza, it's still pizza so I will eat it. Anyway in addition to the late and not frozen order I was missing 30 of the Nashville Chicken Sticks that were to be included. This was not really a problem because they were promptly shipped to me. When these arrived they were still frozen and when I cook them they are exactly how they should be, plump and moist (moist is the kind of word that if said often enough it doesn't sound like a work anymore) :).Anyway this review is only 3 stars but normally I would give 5 stars.Date of experience: June 22, 2022",3

Wendy Rushing,US,"May 23, 2022Verified","Delicious. Great Value. QuickI purchased this food program 2 + weeks ago along with the fasting option. I just started 3 days ago. I’m not rich and this is a great value & surprisingly delicious. I eat on the run between my office, appointments and home office. I eat a lot of junk food and fast food & have gained 33 pounds since last July (knee injury too). I love good food I just don’t want to cook it for one.  Along with extra vegetables (which they offer also) these portions fill me up. I love the spicy options. There is also a list of foods I can eat that are not part of the program. Baked Apple with cinnamon for my sweet tooth, salad, tuna etc. The best part is they heat up in two minutes or less. I am also allergic to shellfish & nuts and have several food sensitivities like wheat, corn & yeast. This program allows me to avoid those while still staying satisfied. My goal is 50 pounds down & in 3 days I’ve lost 6.  That is without the fasting because I forgot to do it.Date of experience: May 23, 2022",5

The option to order just lunch and dinner is wonderful, as our breakfast consists of us frying some eggs and adding a meat with it.Sticking strictly to the diet in the first 2 weeks is essential. I lost 11 pounds during that time (12 days so far) while also training myself to avoid sugar, limit carbs, and make my meals out of one protein and then very veggie friendly. Being a 230 lb man, I found the meal size a bit small but will add more veggies to my meals and ultimately a bit more protein.  Compared to other diets I have tried this one gives you a greater meal size.I combined exercise with the diet and so far feel healthier and stronger. The lack of sugar and carbs has given me more energy.  Shipping was prompt and all items were enclosed in the large cooler.  So far it has been really productive.Date of experience: March 16, 2022",4

Third and final time I’ve had to endure anxiety with delivery arriving as scheduled (1-2 days late). If your choice for logistics service can’t come through consistently then pick another source! Too many concerns with food spoiling if your shipping company can’t commit to an arrival date and speedy but I also can’t be waiting around my house for days waiting for the food to show up. Most recently PTF asked for forgiveness and asked if it was OK to delay my shipment for one week (claiming holiday disruption) and they STILL didn’t meet the delayed shipment date, by two days! When I reached out to customer service to tell them it’s NOT OK because I won’t be home I received no response. I’ll be coming home to rotten food on my porch that should have arrived as originally intended. It’s a shame, food is tasty and it helps dieters stay consistent just wish this company could offer the same consistency with shipments.
