Kaylee Bowers,US,"Dec 23, 2024","Issues with scheduling in the website, but it was resolvedI tried scheduling a bio-metric screening through my work. It was not allowing me to actually schedule on the Lets Get Checked website, nor could I order an at home screening kit. I called and spoke with a customer service rep who was not able to fix the issue, so she placed a support ticket. No one called me back and I checked two weeks later but the issue was still happening. Then, I called again and spoke with Ki. He was very nice and initiated a three way call with my insurance to try to resolve this. The call lasted over one hour and Ki remained patient throughout. He placed a support ticket and I did not think anything would happen. I checked the Let's Get Checked website a few days later and I was able to schedule the biometric screening! Ki called me a day or two later to check in and inform me this was resolved. I greatly appreciate his assistance and follow up call! He seemed to genuinely want to assist me and cared about the issue. Thank you Ki!The 4 stars was due to the experience of the first representative not calling or emailing me to update, nor was the issue resolved until I called again. Ki's service was five stars though. Date of experience: December 23, 2024",4

I had a TSH done earlier with my PCP but preferred a full thyroid panel and thus was thankful to be able to do this through LetsGetChecked.  The two TSH results were the same, and it was great to get the other information. The only negative I can think of is that I wished the lancet needle was a bit sharper.

The test procedure was very straightforward with clear instructions; the 'stick' wasn't painful at all; and the lab processed my submission very promptly - like 24 hours.  The reports are clear and easy to download and share with your healthcare professionals.  I can't provide five stars because it took two weeks to receive my test kit - unacceptable when you're trying to capture bloodwork and diagnose a health problem before exercise and diet change things.

Stephanie,US,"Nov 9, 2024Verified","Quick & Easy TestThe communications from this company through the entire process were exceptional. The test itself is simple to understand and complete. The turnaround for my results took less than a week. The only part I had concerns about was the amount of personal information that they required. I'm not certain it was all necessary to perform the test since I have used a different company in the past and was not asked as many questions.

I called to complain that I would be out $119 and get nothing of value from the company. There they told me that the policy is to actually offer additional test kit materials OR a refund. Questions: why was I told collection would be easy, which it clearly is not? Why wasn’t I offered a refund the first time? Shady company with shady business dealings.

My blood clots well and it is very difficult to get enough blood to fill the vile.  I used four fingers and barely got enough with great pain and effort.  The fact that I am a bass player and guitar player is not good either because the tips and sides of my fingers are sore.

Anthony,US,"Updated Oct 5, 2024Verified","Great system for at home testsI bought their Hepatitis B & C kit after experiencing symptoms of the virus & it was a great experience. The kit was overnighted to me, and back to the labs where I had my results within two days. The kit itself is well thought out & easy to use. I had to pierce my finger multiple times to get the amount of blood needed for the test, but that’s understandable since we aren’t drawing directly from a vein. The app allows you instant access to your results & alerts you once they are in. It was a little pricey compared to the competitors but worth it in my opinion because it was a smooth process which provides peace of mind.

I tried to find out if I had done something incorrectly, but I'm still not sure if I made a mistake.  I probably won't use the QR code in the future.  There was also some confusion about the status of my test ... so that when I made an inquiry I was told that the test results were available, but they were not.  It took an extra email or two to straighten that out.

louise dunne,IE,"Aug 27, 2024","Still waiting on results nearly 2 weeks onReally disappointed in the service, I've used lgc in the past for the thyroid test without issues but this time around my experience has been very poor. Staff confirmed my test was received 14/8 and I should get results within 2-5 business days, when this didn't happen I was then told by 26/8. Still didn't happen. I had my doctors appointment and had to have bloods through them as I couldn't get a new prescription without recent blood results. I ordered and sent back my sample in good time with no sign of my results. Now being told it's a technical error but no results in sight. I will not be using lgc again for my samples due to unreliable service Date of experience: August 14, 2024",1

Valerie Moore,GB,"Updated Aug 23, 2024","Is Letsgetchecked a scam name?I ordered a Vitamin B12 home test kit from Letsgetchecked. I paid just under £60 on my credit card. A few hours later they wrote & said they were out of stock & would refund me WITHIN 30 DAYS. This is an extremely large refund window so I checked my bank card statement and saw they had claimed my payment in the name of LaunchGiftCards, same initials as Letsgetchecked but not the right company name. I suspect fraud. Update: I sent Letsgetchecked a screenshot of the payment confirmation to LaunchGiftCards from my bank statement. They said it was malware from my phone and nothing to do with them. My bank statement this morning now showed Letsgetchecked as the recipient of my payment. I have since written asking where my refund is, and they are ignoring my emails. And still no explanation of why they need to wait 30 business days to receive a refund, when it's because of their low stock that they could not provide the kit.Very unimpressive. A company which exploits its customers.Date of experience: August 22, 2024",1
