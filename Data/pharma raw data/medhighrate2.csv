Yvonne Hutchings,US,17 hours ago,"Worked with Chandler Simpson at this…Worked with Chandler Simpson at this company to find a Medicare supplement for my husband a couple of years ago. He made it so easy, not pushy or aggressive at all, very patient, and actually went over and beyond my expectations. Kept his name and number and now working with him for my own Medicare supplement needs. Have recommended him to neighbors, friends and family members. I had lots of experience with many other brokers before I had the good fortune of dealing with Chandler. So happy to have him in my corner, especially since my needs are more complicated than my husband’s. Date of experience: January 02, 2025",5

Randy,US,"Jan 5, 2025","Things Improved in TimeI wrote my original review based on having received no information or follow-up from my phone call and application process around Dec 19.  I was told I would receive a follow-up phone call on Dec 23.  When I wrote the first review I assumed my application had been denied or dropped, therefore I was discouraged and unhappy.On Jan 2 I received two phone messages from Sahara Rice, the first with her response to my review, the second noting my application with Aflac had been approved. We re-connected on Jan 3 and determined that with her advocacy on my behalf, Aflac approved the policy w/o a follow-up, which was good news.  I understand business processes can grind to a halt over the holidays, so I accept that as a reasonable explanation and give credit to Sahara for her persistence, and ultimately helping to get my policy approved.  Hence, my views have changed reflecting a good outcome, However, there are lingering concerns about how Medicare people are treated in general by the private insurance companies, which frequently compromises decisions made by MDs to provide health care and may trigger negative impacts upon Medicare people by these private insurers providing supplemental coverage. Unfortunately, the agents at UMA are caught in the middle. But on the whole Sahara Rice was courteous, professional and as efficient as she could be in the context of holiday hindrances, and the frankly failed system of private health insurance in the USA.
