States a 30 day refund no questions asked. Changed my mind as it's basically contradicted everything it says you can do ..such as eating carbs, no restrictions..yet it's a keto diet with no carbs. Asked for refund and I'm being asked why I want a refund ..another contradiction. I've filed a dispute with my credit card company. Feel stupid for falling for the bullsh*t.

Muneerah Crawford,US,"Aug 6, 2024","Before I buy any diet supplement I check out the complaints about the product on googleBefore I buy any diet supplement or anything I always check what others are saying about the product.  If someone spends money and they do not loose weight after 60 days, there is something wrong with that.  So I will never do business with this company.  With this many complaints, its obviously a scam.  If they were honest they would refund everyone within the 90 days since their product tastes horrible and it does not work.  They need to go back to the drawing board and then do market research to test the product before selling to the public.  the people who say it works are probably being paid and they probably never tried it or they are not overweight.  So far there is no safe or effective weight loss product on the market including the Ozempic injections which have horrible and dangerous side effects. Date of experience: August 05, 2024",1

I told them I did not want to keep any of them because again I do not like the taste. Then they offered me a 50% discount on the two unopened canisters because the only one that the moneyback guarantee applied to was the first opened canister.  No wonder they want you to buy more than one at a time if they’re only going to refund your money on one.  They also said there would be a 10% return fee.

This was false, after about 60 days of using no results and they said they could only give me a 30% refund. To which I replied what about the 90 days 100% money back guarantee. They are now offering 50% of my purchase refunded and instructed me to read the refund policy. Yea, it does state in the refund policy that you can only get a 100% refund if returning before 30 days. Even though the sales video I watched stated you could return it before 90 days for a full refund. Very shady to state that in the video but hide your real policy. Most people don't read the refund policy before making a purchase. So unfortunately, I am accepting this 50% refund, but I hope people read this and question this company's true intensions.

Well, I find nothing ""normal"" about constipation. For the last couple of years, my digestive track was on a roller coaster ride of psyllium husk and laxatives. After two weeks with Emma and nothing else, I feel like myself again. After three months, my husband noticed the Emma is the real deal and he is now taking it as well.  His story is a bit different and more dramatic. For the last 20 years, he complained of a constant pain in his side.  He had multiple GI evaluations and more that a few GI doctors told him they could find nothing wrong.  (To which I responded that it must be in his head and maybe they should refer him to a psychiatrist. HA!) However, every time he had to take antibiotics for another ailment, the pain in his side subsided.  Problem is that you can't stay on antibiotics perpetually.From my success, I encouraged him to try Emma. He did and now, six weeks later, he said that he feels better than he has in 20 years!

I enjoy the menu options with the protein, fat & carb breakdown. The fact that I can swap this for that is helpful too. If I ever need to reach someone, help is readily available. I'm new to this program. I don't have far to go to reach my comfortable goal weight. I've been doing my own keto way prior to this program, just leaving out carbs. I plateaued. Then I found this program. I'm very excited to have this guided routine to help me get there and then maintain my weight. Thank you. Date of experience: June 05, 2023",4

I’m 50+ & did my research before starting and was overwhelmed by the details of how to navigate, but Konscious keto has given my husband and I a clear path and educated us along the way.  There are tips to the recipes and the recipes are yummy.  The plan changes as time goes to addd things back in & my husband and I could do it together. Since the last week in Sept - he’s gone from 243 to 217 & I’ve gone from 238 to 212 in a 2.5 months .  We feel good.. we avoided the keto flu and are both down 2 inches in our waist and at least one size in clothes.  Family and friends all mention how obvious it is that we are getting healthier… konscious keto has made us successful & we aren’t hungry, or feeling deprived.

The number given on the Invoice is useless.  I spent over 1-1/2 hours, called 5 different ‘wrong’ numbers given to me by Representatives, was asked for my Full Credit Card number 3x…(got scared this might be a scam)& name, address etc.  It was extremely difficult to understand the rep & no matter ‘WHAT’ I asked, my question's  weren’t answered.  It was a complete NIGHTMARE!!!.  2 of the ‘Next Tier Customer Service’ numbers I was given were a Communication Co(Frontier I believe) & the other was an ‘Adult Hook Up’ number.  I really felt like the reps intentionally gave me incorrect information.  They continued to pitch other products talking over me as I asked over & over “ Please just tell me how to return the product & get my refund’.  First Rep said she will send me a text & I MUST reply Yes in order to get my Reference # she initially said she was generating then refused to give to me.  I replied Yes to the text & it signed me up for some other product & charged my credit card.  So then I had to call another number of theirs to find out about my credit by giving Reference # AND I had to call another number to cancel the service I was signed up for & charged to cancel (excuse-error in their system).  I had NO luck with with phone number.  If I knew your Customer Service was so horrible, I would never have purchased any product from you.  Your website is vague & I feel your reps are trained to give Consumers the ‘run around’(false numbers & info) so they get frustrated & just keep the product.  Well, I WANT MY MONEY BACK.  Send me an address or call me with Return Instructions your Customer Service is oblivious to.  Some reps didnt even know what ‘Keto Activate’ was.

Marlene Ll,US,"Updated Dec 4, 2023","BEWAREBEWARE - Something ""hinky"" is going on at this company.  I successfully placed my first order for three bottles with this company many months ago and decided to use the product again.  For three weeks now I have tried to place another order but strange things have happened that I think warrant a ""take care"" warning.  The first re-order attempt saw a successful debit to my charge account and when the order did not arrive a follow-up with ""K"" and my bank showed that they had sent the money back to my bank.  When I called ""K"" I was told to place another order but use another card to make sure that there is no problem with the new order.  Within a few days the second order was refunded to my second bank with no explanation to me or the bank.  Last week I called customer service again and was told that they would place the order from their sales department and send me a payment invoice since I would not give them the card by phone - OH...they told me once again to use a new card.  For the third time in as many weeks the money has been returned again and this time they tell me that their warehouse has flagged my address as being ""fraudulent.""  Since I have received mail at the same address for more than ten years and got their first delivery I asked them to investigate or give me the name of their shipping company. They refused and said it was their warehouse that had flagged me and they would not give me the warehouse manager's name and address so that I could resolve the problem.  They basically indicated via ""Clifford"" that there was nothing they could do ...which leaves me wondering is this some sort of scheme to collect credit card numbers, naturally I will be watching my bank accounts every day because I now have a feeling of distrust in dealing with this company. As of 12/4/23 Additional information requested by the company follows: Order 16122810 placed under husband's name and Order 16046443 placed under my name are the two most recent copies that I have.  There were three orders placed in all within the last two months that were turned back after cashing at the bank. So non-payment was not the issue here!Date of experience: November 19, 2023",1

Wendy Alliman,US,"Mar 4, 2023","The recipes/meal plans are excellent!Eighteen weeks ago I signed up for the year meal plan. Seeing that nothing else has work, decided to give this a try. There is also a one month plan. Although you could keep repeating the same recipes over and over again and still be successful, the yearly plan provides for one year recipes for 3 meals and 1 snack each day. I did not purchase any supplements as I wanted to see how I would do just following the plan. Take the time to be honest when reporting on day 5 of each week. If you actually didn’t eat what was on the week’s menu say so. You’ll notice that by doing so, the menu selection gets more in tune with what you enjoy eating. You’ll be answering questions such as weight, waist measurement, activity level, energy level, if you’ve had cravings, and the percentage of foods that the prepared from the menu. Family  members have enjoyed the recipes, with many not knowing that they are eating keto. Before you really get started in the program, you’ll be invited to a Zoom meeting to go over the program. Take notes. As for the recipes, read the whole recipe, multiple times, as there are tips and alternate baking directions if you do not have the needed equipment, such as a microwave or air fryer, either in the tip section or the comments section. The shopping list is helpful, but it does not list the exact amounts of each ingredient needed. I just review the recipes to ensure that I have not just the needed items, but the quantities needed. Some people print out the recipes; I do not as I can re-access them through the library. You’ll need a cloth tape measure as well as regular scale. Find yourself some kind of exercise that you enjoy and will stick with. It’s part of the process, but not required or forced upon you. If you need an answer to a question, put it into the comment section under a recipe and check back for the answer. They are fairly fast at answering questions, but don’t expect a response as if you are using text or phone. There is also a private FB group that is a supportive group of other individuals in all stages of their weight loss journey. People post pictures of what they’ve been cooking/baking. Please do not demand recipes. It’s part of the group rules. Unfortunately, many people do. The group admin is kind and courteous in reminding everyone that it is up to the original poster as to whether or not they share the recipes. So my experience has been very successful. I have lost so far 30 pounds. This program is a tool that you have to commit to whole heartedly. Don’t go into it “hoping it’ll work.” Date of experience: March 03, 2023",5

Kathleen Lifka,US,"Apr 26, 2021Invited","Useful recipesI was looking for a group that would provide recipes for my husband to make since he's the cook and I'm not.
