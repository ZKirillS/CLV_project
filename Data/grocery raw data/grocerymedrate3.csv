Walter Evan Bircher,US,"Jan 14, 2024Verified","Pros and ConsHave not tried the taco shells yet, but I am anxious to do so.The chips have the thickness and consistency of the fried flour tortilla chips in a Mexican food restaurant. But, they do not have much flavor. However, due to their thickness, I was able to use a keto cowboy cracker recipe to jazz them up a bit. I would buy them again just for that.The tortillas are tiny. Like street taco size. So, I probably will not purchase them again, as I prefer the larger tortillas.The packaging was very good and shipping was decent.

The quality of their products are already top notch, but add excellent customer service and that elevates their overall rating in my opinion.First time trying Mr. Tortilla, and based on my first experience, I will try them again.I ordered the Taco Time bundle of assorted tortillas and hard taco shells, plus the Crispy Chips Bulk Bag of the Black Truffle Sea Salt. The order came well packaged, but unfortunately, one of the 4 bags of hard taco shells came broken. I couldn't use them for tacos, so I ate them as chips.As with any low carb tortillas or chips, they have that dry consistency to them, but not as bad as other low carb options out there. I like the variety they have and the flavors really come out in their tortillas. Since the tortillas aren't made with the usual flour, I don't recommend heating them up on a pan or directly on fire as they are thin and will get hard. I found that microwaving them kept the tortillas soft. The Black Truffle Sea Salt chips were also good. Again, not as dry as other low carb chips on the market. They are also hard enough to eat with a dip.Had to knock off one star due to a bag of the hard taco shells being broken, but overall, I really enjoy Mr. Tortilla products and will purchase more of their products.Date of experience: January 24, 2024",5
