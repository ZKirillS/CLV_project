Kylara Jayne Unverrich,US,"Dec 17, 2024","Rite Aid pharmacy is a headache My disabled, elderly client just moved to the area a month ago and switched to Rite Aid pharmacy since it's the closest to her home (mind you she doesn't drive).It's been a headache since. This place can't even fill a prescription after a week and a half. They keep using the excuse of being under staffed.My client is diabetic and completely out of insulin!!!! We called it in over a week ago! We went last week to pick up her prescriptions and they filled 2 she had plenty of and never asked for those prescriptions to be refilled. Then two of the ones she did request to be filled they never refilled and still a week later haven't refilled! It's one excuse after another! They never answer the phones. You can't get through to anyone. Even the staff are rude and completely unhelpful.Should have taken one of the ladies staff members advice when we first transferred my client's prescriptions there.... She stated that they're completely understaffed and wouldn't recommend that if we want our prescriptions within a reasonable time we go somewhere else.Date of experience: December 16, 2024",1

Jeanette Gang,US,"Oct 5, 2024","I had a very pleasant experience with the Rite Aid Pharmacy in Mechanicsburg, PAI had a very pleasant experience with a Rite Aid pharmacist earlier today. Her name is Ang and she works at the Rite Aid on the Carlisle Pike in Mechanicsburg, PA. My husband had been in the emergency room earlier in the day. The emergency room had submitted a prescription a different Rite Aid that was unable to fill the prescription. I then called the Rite Aid in Mechanicsburg and, although the medicine was not in stock at her location either, Ang took the time to help me track down a Rite Aid location that had stock on hand. She also took the time to explain how to have the original Rite Aid record the prescription so I could pick it up at a different location. My recent experience with pharmacists has been that they are too busy to provide specialized attention. I'm sure Ang was very busy too, but that didn't stop her from giving exceptionally great service.Date of experience: October 05, 2024",5

When I went to collect on April 11, I was told they were not ready and I should come back on April 28. I felt so let down: we are talking medicine I must take daily and they all need to be on time. The above was not the first time it happened. The pharmacy staff, especially the pharmacists, come across as very uncaring, unprofessional and unhelpful. I decided to take my business elsewhere. I am glad I did. Walgreens, I found, has a very good App with excellent functions, among which is a step-by-step guide to switch from Rite Aid to Walgreens without leaving home. A painless transition. And I am very happy and, honestly, quite relieved, with my switch. Customers should never have to tolerate shockingly bad treatment - when this happens, they should take their business elsewhere.Date of experience: April 13, 2022",1

I went online and their website sucks.  The items on sale I wanted were not there and when I tried to purchase a few things, it kept changing the number of items.  They need a new technology person to seriously fix their website.  Also, why make it difficult for buyers to get a discounted price on items.  It does not make sense.  If you don't want to give a discounted price, then don't do it.  If you do it, do it right.  No point in making every customer work hard for a coupon/discount.

Morgantown Resident,US,"Jan 7, 2023","Rite Aid lied about receiving script from doctor's officeDoctor's office sent script in for my husband for his Parkinson's Disease, a medication, that he MUST have.

If you don't believe their lies, you're told you are being rude to them.  Then she blames technology, like who believes that excuse.  She lied to us about getting the script because twice we called the doctor's office and twice, they said they sent it in once by phone call, then by fax. Then we get a computer call back from Rite Aid telling us that they don't carry the medication requested. So apparently they did get the script from the Doctor's office.

Nor can you list them You have to call the pharmacy and have them provide the list for you.Nor do they notify you when they are refilled. Their web site is a cautionary tale of what not to do.

Just last week I was in there to pick up an Amazon package and the lady at the register rolled her eyes at me and walked off. Like what?? I was the only one in line. That is the mildest complaint I have about their attitudes towards customers. It's sad. I look forward to the day I don't ever have to step foot in that armpit of a store ever again.Date of experience: October 21, 2021",2

He never asked me about open profile to get any prescriptions medication. I requested him to call Walgreens to get our prescription transferred we waited one hr and pharmacists told me Walgreens never fax the prescription so I came back after one hr and called Walgreen pharmacist she said she faxed the prescription hour before and fax transcript saying ok but ride aid pharmacist saying he never got it. I requested ride aid pharmacist to call wall green again to call her and get the prescription information. Which he did. But why rite aid pharmacy so bad to give service to a customer. I know pharmacists intentionally gave me hard time because I complained about one pharmacy technician her name is Fauzia.I hope any of higher Management should talk to give better service and do not throw out customers like me.

However over the last few months our Rite Aid in Tallmadge, Ohio has turned into the worst pharmacy to deal with. I am recovering from surgery and can't drive at the moment and I needed to talk to the pharmacist about some reactions I was having. I called for 3 days several times a day and they wouldn't answer their phone. I had to call the assistant store manager and she had to go tell them to pick up their phone. When my husband stopped to pick up my prescriptions they weren't ready and said to come back in 2 hours. He went back in 2 hours and one was missing. He asked them to fill it. The pharmacy assistant said no we would have to come back the next day. The explanation given was that they wer closing. This was at 8 pm and the pharmacy is open until 9. She wouldn't give a reason or look into why it hadn't been filled. Then she started just making up excuses and telling him how she should be spoken to. He went in and the pharmacist unwilling explained the situation with a bunch of attitude. I called and left a message for the store manager because I really wanted to let her know what had happened. I am not someone who calls and complains but 3 days of not answering the phone then this is just ridiculous. I understand why the company is struggling with my experience as well as all the reviews I read on here.

I was threatened to have my prescription canceled and to go to another  pharmacy after I came in to pick up a refill that was promised to be ready Friday morning. I had to go out of town and was pressed for time, but he said my refill was going to the end of the line and was forced to wait 3 1/2 hours, and he told me if I didn't be quiet and leave he would cancel it and I would have to get a new one from my Dr's office and take it somewhere else!! Then he refused to call my insurance to get a travel override so I had to pay 174.00 in cash. When I reported this to the 800 # I got a call back from the district office saying I could get a customer service refund that day, so I went back to the store and the ""manager "" on duty refused to give a refund saying I'm not giving you 174.00 in ""free "" money, then he called me a F-----g scumbag and a liar on the way out. Next day I called the 800 # again, tell another woman from the pharmacy what happened and there was no apology this time, no lip service, just irritated that I was still bothering them and she told me that I would get nothing, and it was just my fault and my problem. I think this company is so used to dis respecting and insulting customers that they believe they can do and say whatever they want with no consequences. NO INTEGRITY whatsoever.

My husband was not able to pick it up until Saturday and when he did they had filled my inhaler for a $50 copay after I had just picked my inhaler up two weeks prior to this. They did not have my Metformin ready!! They said they called my Doctor but evidently did not check to see if the Metformin Rx was filled. They instead just filled the Rx for what they say was a computer automatic refill for the inhaler - evidentally my Doctor was never called!!   I was angry having to shell out another $50 copay for a RX that I would not need for a couple more weeks and still did not have my metformin!  Of course my Doctor's office was closed today and it was impossible to get my Metformin filled today even though they told me to take it up with my Doctor if the refill was wrong.  The head Pharmacist, Michael, implied I must be senile and maybe forgot how many doses I had used of my inhaler since I still had two weeks worth and by his account I should have been out.  He said I picked up the Rx a month ago.  Which I did not do since I still had two weeks puffs left in my inhaler.  Anyway he is suppose to give me 8 pills emergency since my Doctor office was closed. He promised I could pick up the Metformin tomorrow on Sunday at any register. Hopefully this is true.  Once they even gave me someone else's pills. Yes they are going to kill someone since they are so busy they are not following up or double checking with the client when they fill Rx's.  Michael said they are too busy to do that.

The manager, Cory DiCarlo, is always friendly and helpful. Anytime I use the pharmacy, which is monthly, it has been without issue. Today we were helped by a white woman, middle aged, hair in ponytail. She had an attitude every time she spoke with either of us. I couldn‚Äôt understand why. Honest to god, no idea what her problem was. My brothers face was in very poor shape due to his accident this morning. His face was scraped and red all over with a broken nose and gash in his forehead. This guys clearly already having an awful day, why she seemed to have a bone to pick with him was beyond me. The last thing she did was throw the bag of medicine on the counter at him. It was the rudest part of the entire interaction. I was so appalled at that point. I couldn‚Äôt not react to her. I said, ‚Äúhave a great day!‚Äù. That‚Äôs all, but I said it with attitude. I simply couldn‚Äôt hold back my attitude anymore in response to hers. It was belligerent and intentional. Why, I haven‚Äôt got the slightest clue? But I feel that someone else who matters should be asking her what her problem is. Someone just got out of the hospital, is now out of work because of their accident, and has just had a really rough day and wants to go home, take their medication, and rest. He didn‚Äôt need her attitude as if he had done something wrong, offended, or mistreated her or anyone else. It was the most uncalled for attitude I‚Äôve ever gotten from a cashier.

Then I'm overcharged, even though I gave them the insurance info 2 days before. So COURTNEY tells me to step aside. I tell her I have food in the car, she tells me to go out & wait with my food. So I'm left standing there while they wait on others. So I got angry which after everything I've already delt with b/c of them I think I had every right and she tells me she doesn't get paid enough to deal with people like me. So I tell her again I have food in the car & I'm expected to get it home. (My family was waiting) and she tells me ""that's not my problem"".  I told her, all of this mess is YOUR problem! At that point the pharmacist finally came over & took care of the refund for me. I had only started going there because my scripts were cheaper BUT I immediately went to my old pharmacy & had them transfer my scripts back to them.

I followed the instructions in the email I received and experience the worse customer service I have ever had. First, I walked into the (which was an option or curbside). I ""was"" going to purchase more items once I picked up my order which unfortunately didn't happen. I walked up the counter where the ""online pick up"" sign was (as instructed in the email). The young lady behind the counter was sitting down talking to someone and never acknowledged me. Then another customer came up to the counter, she went over and checked him out as well as 2 other customers that stepped up after. When I asked if I needed to be in another line for my pick up, she  laughed and said that I didn't need to come inside, they would have brought it out to me. She continued helping the other customers. When no one else was in line, she grabbed my order and pointed to the end of the counter without a word. As she was processing the order in the register she finally asked my name. After she completed my order and handed me the bag I asked to speak to the Manager on Duty. She proceeded to yell for someone named ""T"" and then told her a customer wanted to talked her. When the manager came from the back the girl never even directed her to me. I had to stop the manager from walking to the counter. After  telling her the issue, she did say she was sorry but I don‚Äôt feel anything will be done about this.

The young lady took the prescription and looked up the account and showed the on duty pharmacist to ensure they had the tablets. After discussing it with the pharmacist she brought the prescription back to me and said they could not fill it because the Vet had not written my address on it and they could not write it on there. All of the prescriptions I have had filled there never had the address written on them so I asked if something had changed from last month when the same exact prescription was filled at the same exact pharmacy. I was not upset and just asked the question, the pharmacist then came to the counter and started telling me that the DEA had strict rules on this medication, to which I asked her if the rules had changed from last month to which she rudely said if you would let me finish and stop jumping down my throat. I told her I was not jumping down her throat but was asking a question. I told her to please proceed and she again stated that the DEA had strict rules on the medication, I again told her I was not questioning the rules but asking if the rules had changed since last month to which she replied no. I then asked if they only enforced the rules sometimes since they had never done it before. She got upset and told me to leave and never come back. I was a little dumbfounded because I was just asking questions. I asked her for her name which she refused to give so I ten asked for the number to Coporate to which she replied I am sure you can figure it out yourself.

In 2018 I moved to Lancaster and my husband, and I went to the Rite Aid on Central Ave, in Lancaster.  We both had nothing but issues with them, Rx not filled in a timely manner or not at all.  Then we are asked to wait or come back, only to come back and they are still not filled. I signed up for TEXT alerts, which I had in Fairport and to this day have not received one from the Pharmacy telling me my script is done.  I have signed up 2x‚Äôs for this service with zero results.  IN 2018 my husband got fed up and went to Walgreens and has had no issues at all, he told me to go there but I really like the Rite Aid and was trying to be loyal to this one.  The Pharmacist is very rude, she is just too full of herself to help.  We have had insurance issues, my husbands company changed providers and we got new cards- I gave them the new card and thought they were using it.  I found out for over a year they were not using the right card and our Rx‚Äôs were no going through the correct insurance.  Apparently, they were using a coupon, which I was not even aware of. I went to pick up my Rx and ask for a copy of my Rx receipts because I was not seeing them on my plan.  She told me I did not have insurance, after an explosive minute, I gave her my card again. She then told me I would have to wait and come back the next day because she had to call my Dr to rewrite the script. Was she crazy I never heard of such a thing, I even questioned her thinking she meant insurance, but no she meant Dr. So, I paid reg price and told to make sure it was in the computer for next month. OMG guess what it was not there, my Rx was not ready, I told them I would be back at 9am to have it ready.  My husband was they‚Äôre at 9:15 and was told he would have to wait 20 minutes.

Karen JM Mutarelli,US,"Dec 6, 2021","This is very important to read all of it!This is very important to read: I always went to Rite Aid on route 70, it's always been a great place with people who I have known for many years. Myself and my boyfriend Frankie needed to get a flu shot. Due to my health I don't go out much. On this day it was a warmer so I decided to go out. While I was out I said Frankie we should get our flu shots. I looked up who was taken walk-in's. Rite Aid on Mule Rd., was taken them. We went in and went to the back where the Pharmacy is and said to the women we were there to get our flu shot. She was very busy and not real friendly, said we had to fill out paperwork. She also asked for our license's and Insurance cards. We said ok. She went on to say she asked us if we got our COVID shot we said we did. She went onto say she needed the card. I said for a flu shot? She said ""It's our procedure"", We thought it was odd but now a days who knows maybe they have to add it to the COVID records. I was not happy and sent my Boyfriend to get them from the car. I said to her can I start to fill out the paperwork, she said NO she needed the card. Frankie came back in with the cards. We showed them to her. We filled out the paperwork and one spot asked why we were there, or something to that effect. I put Flu shot, Frankie didn't put anything in his. I said to the woman "" You look very flushed, she stated she was. I said I felt bad for her, she again stated she had done over 300 people and wasn't done for the day yet. At least I got her to smile. We were told to go sit and wait until we were called. After a while we were called in. I started to talk to the woman who was giving the shots. We talked for awhile and I said ok lets do the shot. I got mine first, all along thinking it was the flu shot. when Frankie got his and we were still talking. I have a very friendly personality and can easily talk to anyone. When she did the shot she said ""I almost hit the bone"". I said ""wow, good thing you didn't. She never gave Frankie back his paperwork and as we were leaving she was calling for Frank, I thought she meant the guy behind us. Frankie looked in the plastic box she was holding and said ""That's mine"", I said she gave you back your paperwork and the guy behind us was named Franklin. Again I thought it was him. Frankie said ""That's me, that's my license"". We kind of laughed about and left. After a couple hours Frankie's arm was killing him and he wasn't feeling good. I said ""Maybe because the way she gave you the shot almost hitting the bone"". That lasted for a few days. I have many health issues including muscle pain. From that day on it has gotten so much worse. I didn't think about it at the time. That following week we had to go see our Primary Doctor which was 1 week since we had gotten it. Our Doctor asked if we had gotten the flu shot we said we did. Not until 1 week later when we got home from the Doctor and Frankie was going to file his paperwork he looked and said ""Can you come here for a minute, I think they gave us the booster"". I said ""No they didn't it was the flu shot"".  When I looked at the paperwork Rite Aid gave both of us it stated it was the booster shot. Frankie called the store immediately we were told to come in, which we did. The Manager at that time came over and we told him the whole story. He printed out the paperwork we filled out. Mine stated Flu shot, and on Frankie's someone put in MDR or something like that. I was fuming and said to the Manger "" I wasn't sure if I even was going to get the booster shot. With my heath I wasn't going to take another shot then months from now they would come out with another one. Not only that the day we went only people 65 and older were getting the booster. I was 61 and Frankie was 64. They had no right to give us a shot that first we were not eligible for, second we weren't sure we wanted. The Manger was very kind and understanding. He said he was going to send our information to the main office and someone would get back to use either that day or the following day.To date December 6, 2021, we still have not heard a word.It's total outrageous, who gives them the right to give us a shot we didn't want? If this woman was paying attention and not over whelmed this would have never happened.

Christine Nidd,US,"Jul 14, 2021","The only positive thing I have to say about Rite Aid is that they are consistent in disappointing me.I learned to lower my expectations of Rite Aid, and still they don't measure up. I scheduled a COVID test at their drive in site and the web site and confirmation email said 1-3 days for results. AFTER waiting 15 minutes past my appointment and completing the test, they said 2-5 days. When I pointed out my confirmation said 1-3 days I was told they had no control over the lab. Well...that really isn't helpful. As everyone knows, in order to travel you need results for a sample within 72 hours or the test can't be used for travel. Rite Aid should be upfront about their inability to meet required timeframes so people have the opportunity to book with an organization that is more capable and accountable.Date of experience: July 14, 2021",1

After waiting for several days with no results from¬†Project Baseline, we decided to do another test directly with our son's medical provider (Kaiser), and received the results in less than 24 hours. Despite following up in all the recommended ways, we still haven't gotten results from Project Baseline.The difference between these two experiences is stark. It was very stressful and frustrating to wait so long for results from Project Baseline, given that we're a year into the pandemic and most facilities in LA seem to have streamlined¬†their processes to be more efficient by now.¬†In particular, we were disappointed by the lack of clarity around how the timeline for results would be¬†impacted by the fact that the test was done on a Friday. In all the communications before and during his test, no mention was made of the fact that the expected turnaround time referred to business days only. It wasn't until several days later when we inquired about the delay that we received clarification that weekends were not included when calculating the expected turnaround time.Had we known this, we would have gone through Kaiser from the beginning.¬†I realize and am grateful that we have access to Covid related resources that many others in the world do not.

He actually said at one point that he was uncomfortable giving my daughter her second COVID shot. I think this was because he didn‚Äôt like the fact that I called the Rite-Aid customer service # to ask about the policy.

Could be an old stock. I returned it the next day. I told the lady, when I bought it the guy(cashier) asked me if I wanted the receipt, I trusted riteaid so I said No. I told her she could check my Riteaid card for proof and she said it doesn't work that way. The lady was not courteous, no smiles, no ""I'm sorry about that"". No customer service was what I felt. Take it or leave it was what I felt. She just said without a receipt i can only give you back the lowest price for that product in that month. I bought it for $15+ and only got back $7+. No way this product was sold for $7+ in the month of June. That is a big loss. If I would have lost a couple of bucks I would have been fine. But more than half of it is ridiculous considering next day return and never used. I even asked her to check the product but she said not necessary. I have never been asked if I wanted the receipt from any other establishments except for Riteaid and for a visa card print out. If your policy is to have a receipt to return goods then why tell/trained your staff to ask customers if they wanted a receipt or throw it out? Its already printed (was in his hands), just give it. Is it so that Riteaid can make money on customers like me if there's a return? First and last for me.

They left me for 45 minutes at the one Rite Aid and then when I had to travel to the other Rite Aid they had me wait another hour and a 1/2 and then finally at 10 minutes to 9:00 p.m., they called to tell me that there was nothing that they could do for me.  That I would now have to go to urgent care, which by the way, would put me at risk for Corona virus and what other Infections there are out there.They are incompetent and this is not the 1st time that I've had issues with them.    They refuse to tell me who put this in the system so that I could go to a higher up. I will be talking to the VA, my doctor, Facebook, and anybody else that will listen out there. Rite Aid is not the place to go for your meds or anything else. They do not care about the health of their customers and should be put out of business!!!!!Date of experience: January 23, 2021",1

I'd push 3 again and go through the same process.  Over and over.  I also pushed 5 (talk to a store employee) and this was the same except the phone rings there 12 times.  I went through this cycle over and over.  How long did it last?  After 15 minutes I got in my car and drove to the store, while still connected.  They finally answered literally as I pulled up in the lot.  There were two clerks in the front (one was actually the manager) and I saw 1 customer.  No one in line.  I explained my issue with the manager and she said they must have been busy.  I went back to the pharmacy.  There were two people behind the counter, one helping a customer who was finishing paying.  There was also a customer filling out a form, but not occupying the pharmacists attention.  That's it - no line.  I asked why they couldn't be bothered to answer for 30 minutes, and the pharmacist told me ""believe it or not, there was just a crowd here a minute ago"".  Ok - she gave me the choice, and I don't believe it.  And I don't appreciate people lying to me.  Terrible customer service.Date of experience: January 09, 2021",1

They constantly make decisions only to reverse on them in a matter of days.  With just a elective business course in high school, I know that if you're making changes to a brand, you have to give some time to see the results, from a couple of months to a few years.

It was a very busy day with a long line to pick up prescriptions. I needed to get my prescription that day and start the medication.Michelle told me the Encinitas store was out of the first choice for my RX but she did have the second choice. Then there was a problem with the way the RX was written by the doctor, so she  tried calling Shiley Eye Institute back because the incorrect amount was written on the prescription.(They wrote 1 and it should have been .1).The institute closed at 4:30 so she could not make contact. Then she took more time to find out what Rite Aid store would have the first medication that was preferred. She called two stores before finding one that actually had the correct medication on hand. MIchelle did all of this even though the line was growing longer and longer. She had only one assistant at the register ringing up and more than six people in line.I thanked her but feel she really went above and beyond in finding my medication. Please let her supervisors know that Michelle is a stellar employee and valued by  customers. From now on when I have a choice of where to fill my RX I am going to MIchelle because she really cares. It would have been much easier for her to tell me I had to wait until she could get it in stock. Then I would have had to scramble and call and drive all over to town to get my RX filledI was very impressed with her work ethic.

The manager walks by me as I get into line and picks up the Lindor chocolate, goes to the cashier and asks if he can do a price check on whether they're really 75% off.  The cashier confirms that they are and the manager says he's going to buy them himself.  I tell the manager I had  just picked those up but then took the kit cats.  Then he asks if I'm ready to check out so I walk up and say I hope these are 75% like they said.  He says they're not and I said then I'd like the ones I would have grabbed if I knew these weren't 75% off.  He said I'm buying those.  I said that I would have bought them if the other item wasn't incorrectly on the shelf.  He said that's too bad I'm buying them.

I waited until March 31 to call the customer service (waited for one hour to be connected with a real person). I asked why my order status was still processing. She checked and told me they had the products in distribution center now and she would send me a tracking #. So today is April 3, the order status is still processing.Date of experience: April 04, 2020",1

Elaine Hepworth,US,"Mar 26, 2020","Rite aid cancels without your knowledge and refuses to fulfill orderI ordered some things online and they never sent me an email of my order and never even bothered to send me what I ordered.  I am glad I screenshot the order number and the day that I ordered.  They cancelled my order without my knowledge and customer service sucks.... their online form didn‚Äôt work, they wouldn‚Äôt answer their phones.  I suggest never ordering from them ever!!Date of experience: March 26, 2020",1

Mary Smith,US,"Mar 16, 2020","Rite Aid is scamming its customers!Rite Aid is scamming its customers!Placed an order, received confirmation of the order and that everything I ordered was in stock.Received an email 2 days later stating that my order was delayed.Called and was told that most of my order was ""out of stock.""  Was told that it would be 5 to 7 business days before I would be refunded! BUT was also told that the ""refund"" would have to be reviewed and approved!  Rite Aid can hold the money forever because they ""might"" get the items in and when they do they can send them then.  REALLY?Items are not in stock, they lie to get you to order so they can keep your money indefinitely.What is happening to America?  There is no longer any accountability and these companies are getting away with fraud.Do not believe the good reviews - they are made up by Rite Aid administrators to fool consumers.Stay away from Rite Aid.Date of experience: March 16, 2020",1

Jordan M Ehrlich,US,"Updated Feb 3, 2020","First and last Rite-Aid experience ever.I need a high-fiber diet; none of the stores around here were carrying fiber one anymore, so I ordered 9 boxes from riteaid to get free shipping 1 week ago, it said 3-5 days delivery.  Big mistake to rely upon them!  Order went through, but I checked on the order on Saturday and it still said Processing!  Tried to contact, but no one working on the weekend, OK.  Tried to leave a message, but contact form is so buggy that the only way to enter a message is to click submit and have the error handler put your cursor in the unclickable message box.  Then you try to click send but it says you have to select a message topic, but that is unclickable as well, from mobile or desktop, chrome and edge.  Over half of the support option buttons are missing, the one to contact the webmaster goes to a 404 page (very fitting).  Anyway, checked sunday, still processing, checked this morning, Monday a week after order, still processing.  Contacted support, they told me (after 10 minutes, ""sorry, your order has been canceled due to being out of stock.  Please re-order when it's in Stock""OK, why didn't the site notify me BEFORE I ORDERED that it was out of stock?  Or maybe after at some point?  Would it have stayed in Processing indefinitely??  How to even know when it's in Stock?  I asked if Rite-Aid could go ahead and expedite the order to me at no charge, I was told, ""Sorry, we only have Standard Shipping.  Plus we're out of stock""  Anyway, still had not received a refund, so I disputed the charge through credit card.  I should have received my fiber cereal in plenty of time before I ran out, but now I am out and out of luck.  Thankfully a local Target carries it; I would've thought a pharmacy would be more time-and-customer-conscious.  First and last Rite-Aid experience ever.Date of experience: February 03, 2020",1

Tina,US,"Updated Jan 27, 2020","Rite Aid in Ridgecrest CA Hires Convicted Thief BEWAREI was totally blown away when I saw a picture posted on the internet December 19 2019 of employees at location 101 N. China Lake Blvd. Ridgecrest California 93555 giving basically thumbs up. I could not believe this being posted, as employee Susan Tunget was one of the employees featured in the picture. It is well known around Ridgecrest that this employee has been convicted on two counts of Welfare Fraud to Obtain Aid. This information can be found on The Kern County Superior Court website. If she had no problem committing fraud, are we to believe that she will not also steal from customers? Just because she is  sleeping/living with one of the stores shift supervisors, Douglas Sperry, is no reason she should have gotten employment here. Don't just take my word on this, Google her name and decide for yourself.Date of experience: January 27, 2020",2

What shipping department in the world is so stupid that they ship via FED EX to a USPS PO BOX.

Deborah,US,"Jan 18, 2020","Poor service at North Babylon, NY pharmacyRepeated difficulties month after month filling an Aimovig prescription with a manufacturer‚Äôs coupon. Instead of finding out how to process the coupon, they kept sending me away and telling me the coupon couldn‚Äôt be applied. One month customer service for the coupon called for me and told them how to process it. The very next month, they again told me the coupon couldn‚Äôt be applied. I spent 30 minutes in the store asking Yunah the pharmacist to please just call the number on the coupon to find out how to process it.  I was treated so rudely by Yunah and Thea the cashier, I never picked up the prescription. Instead I had it transferred to a local, independent pharmacy. I couldn‚Äôt be happier. They fill the prescription each month without a problem. They get paid $500 and I receive my medication. Not only do I not use the pharmacy, I won‚Äôt purchase anything in the store anymore either.Date of experience: January 18, 2020",1
