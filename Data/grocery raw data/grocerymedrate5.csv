I suspected it as a fraud or theft, so I followed up on shipment status on February 2nd 2024. Agent Proxy Ms. Tracy via re-amazeme.com responded on 3rd Feb and refunded, which is awesome. But seems like a fancy HealthCentralUSA website, with a dysfunctional organization behind the scene. They maybe careless and take advantage of ignorance. If I had not followed up, they wouldn't cared to refund. Seems group of disintegrated small unprofessional businesses working together.

Joe Stangarone,US,"Feb 2, 2024","This company is not a scamMany reviews on this site claim that it is a scam. I thought so, too, for a while, but it isn't.When you place an order, be clear if you are signing up for local pickup in the Dallas area. I did this without realizing it and expecting it to be delivered, so there was some confusion. It turns out in the end that the product was out of stock at the manufacturer anyway.Emails were not returned when trying to contact someone about what happened to my order, and the phone number listed on their Facebook page didn't work. This is when I began to think that I had been scammed.Eventually, however, someone contacted me, and a full refund was issued.As with any online retailer I'm unfamiliar with, I should've first seen if I could contact their customer service department before placing an order. I recommend anyone else do the same.This company is not a scam, but maybe a small company still working out the details of order delivery and customer communication.Date of experience: January 05, 2024",5
