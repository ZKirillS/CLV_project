roxana,US,"Dec 18, 2024","Awful first experience followed by more…Awful first experience followed by more issues.  First, I placed an order for a type of yogurt that I can no longer find in my area.  The way the items were packaged allowed for the yogurt to move in transit and 2 of the 6 containers spilled all over the place.  Additionally, the order was received on Oct 11th and all containers had an expiration of Oct 16th, which is really not great.  So I contacted them via chat and I was told I should be hearing back from them within a business day.  This happened on Oct 11th, and by October 16th I had not heard back from them so then I emailed the whole chat transcript to their support group.  Meanwhile, I had discovered that I had 2 charges on my account for the same amount (close to $100/charge).  After much back and forth they gave me a credit for one of the charges and promised to undo the 2nd charge.  But did they?  No, I had to follow up again and they finally refunded the 2nd charge.On Dec 15th I decided it was time to use the store credit and be DONE with this company.  So I ordered the same darn yogurt but this time around the total exceeded the store credit by less than $1 so I had to add my credit card again.  I double and triple checked that the store credit will be applied and then placed the order.  I immediately saw an alert from my credit card that the charge was for the full amount so I reached out to the company and asked to have to store credit applied.  They responded fairly promptly that it didn't get applied when I placed the order and there is nothing they can do.  I immediately asked to have the order cancelled and here we are at the end of the 2nd business day since my reply I haven't heard back.  Just now I got a shipping notification.  So the saga will continue...My advice, stay away from this darn company.  I genuinely cannot wait to be done with them and their unscrupulous ways of doing business.

Order was shipped by them UPS and somehow delivered to the local United States Post Office.  The post office refused to return it so UPS could deliver it (no mail box at this rural location).  These guys said I had to contact UPS but when I did,  UPS said Food Service Direct was the shipper and I could not change it.  Instead of them simply taking charge and getting it fixed, they launched into blaming me and quoting their rules and regulations.  Then they started blasting me with their inability to do anything more because of Walmart policies.  So I escalated my issue direct to Walmart and they solved the issue in TWO minutes saying Food Service should have never treated me like they did and just handled it.   So after 14 days of back and forth I got credited by Walmart and they sent me a coupon for 25% my next purchase... which I will not use at Food Service Direct...  they suck.  🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 Then after acting like its all my problem... then they answer this review with baloney of 100% satisfaction.

arjuna pettit,US,"Updated Mar 8, 2024","Bad experience with these peopleOn October the 5th I bought a 25 lb box of yuquina crabs. From food direct. The box came to my home Frozen a block of solid ice. After Googling the best way to thaw crabs.. was to put them in the refrigerator. It took 3 days for the crabs to thaw. Even though the crabs were still in ice I was able to break them apart. Bag them tasted a few, and got sick.very sick.. I called the company to report this. I told the company I don't care about the monies send me another box of fresh crabs.. the company did not want to reimburse my monies or send me another box of fresh crabs.. I called the better Business bureau filled out a form and this is taking forever I paid $300.50. here it is March 2024.. and I'm still not able to get anything done. I've never had a company to treat me this way.. this is bad business. The company was not even concerned about me getting sick from the crabs. I'm still trying to find out what to do to get my $300.50 back. I don't know how often that this company do this to people but they will never have to worry about me buying anything from them again not ever.. the crabs came in the box a block of ice.. it took 3 days to thaw the ice in the refrigerator the only place to put them. I wasn't going to sit up and run hot water on the crabs trying to thaw.. that would have been a bad move. And the crabs were still on ice even after they thawed.. it's no way they can go bad even in the refrigerator still sitting in ice. you sold the crabs to me bad that simple. Stop trying to justify it just refund me my money you know you sold me bad crabs.. no way to treat customers after you receive moneys. Just to send me a bad product,. And the people in customer service know what's going on they're all liars.. I have pictures of black mold and big black holes in the crabs.  I just talked to Richard he said he saw the pictures . And there was nothing he could do for me bad company bad business. Do not deal with this company people if they did it to me they could do it to others. this is bad business they didn't even care about the fact that I got sick . It's also bad when a company can just rob you of your money and there's nothing you can do about it.

Shame on you,US,"Aug 19, 2023","I ordered Actual Veggie BurgersI ordered Actual Veggie Burgers. My absolute favorite food. I eat 2 a day so the actual veggie company told me that since I go through so many I could order from food service direct. I ordered 2 cases of the green burgers (80) burgers. When I received my item I opened the undamaged box , to find the top box was wet and the tape was barely attached, and the plastic dry ice bag had condensation and liquid dripping out. I lifted the box out and as i did the bottom fell out and the burgers fell to the ground. The second box i was very careful to remove so the same thing wouldnt happen. Again the tape was loose and it was wet as well. I called and explained to the rep what took place. She said I needed to send photos of the boxes , So I walked to the trash and removed the boxes and snapped photos. Thats all I was told was needed. I put the ones that fell in my normal trash bin. Two days later through email im told they need photos of the burgers. I state Im not digging through my trash , I should have been told that first. Basically they are just trying to get out of compensating me for poor packaging. I see by others reviews, thats their jam. Im old enough to know that a guarentee is only as good as the person / company giving it.Shame on you....Date of experience: August 17, 2023",1

I had left a message at Food Service Direct Friday morning, not really expecting a return call as I am just one person, not a restaurant or food supply store. I was delighted when Bianca S. called me back! I explained my dilemma in needing an order for 50 people in three days for a church luncheon. She very calmly walked me through the shipping options. She even called her shipping department to make sure I would get them in time - going from one coast to the other! The order was processed on Monday morning (too late to get it in the day I called, Friday). It was shipped next-day air and I kept my fingers crossed. Lo and behold, my order arrived the next day, as promised. I was jumping for joy! We served the cabbage rolls at our luncheon and everyone LOVED them! I gave all the credit to Bianca in Virginia and soon everyone was praising Bianca in Virginia for getting this order to us on time for our luncheon. The cabbage rolls were large, sauce was great and they tasted excellent. The quality was above and beyond expectations having never had these rolls before.

We were so happy to find the WONDERFUL olive bread rolls on the Foodservicedirect.com site. We were worried they wouldn't get here in time, as we were on a tight deadline. Not only did they make it here in plenty of time for the event, but EVERYONE loved the flavor of the rolls. Thank you for the great service. We will be back!!!Date of experience: February 01, 2023",5

David Green,US,"Updated Jan 5, 2023","This disreputable company is not recommended (amended)I ordered a set of 12 dinner plates that have unsightly defects in the glaze.  These plates are unsuitable for putting on a dinner table.  I wish I could post a picture to show just how horrid they look.I have gone round and round with this company's ""customer service"" department.  They have offered no efforts at a resolution.  They keep telling me my satisfaction is important to them but, apparently, that's a lie as they will take no steps whatsoever to resolve this unfortunate situation.They've made it clear I'm stuck with these plates.  End of discussion. It's not their problem. Over $160 for plates that must go directly to the dump.Reading through some other reviews, I have lost count of how many times this company responds : ""Customer satisfaction is our top priority.""  This is clearly not the case.  It seems like avoiding responsibility is really their top priority.Update (1/5/23) : I have now received a full refund for the defective plates and I plan to resume doing business with them.Date of experience: December 19, 2022",3

Anonymous,US,"Oct 4, 2022","Misinformation Then Canceled OrderI am a former customer who had had some up-and-down experiences with FSD but was eager to give them another try because they list so many hard-to-find items on their website. On September 19 I received an email alert from FoodServiceDirect that my product was back in stock. I ordered it within half an hour. It was on special order so I expected a delay. After seeing the charge authorization drop from my credit card a week later, I contacted Food Service Direct customer service to confirm that the item would indeed be special ordered and fulfilled. I was told that yes, it would, and it would arrive by October 14, and I would receive a tracking number when it shipped. I was so happy.Yesterday I noticed the price of the item increased by about $15 on the website, so I was glad I already had my order in. Today I received a notice saying that due to supply chain issues, the order was canceled. It is now listed as Out of Stock again on website, at the higher price point. If it wasn't available to special order I should never have received a back-in-stock notice, and upon checking with customer service to see if it would be fulfilled I should have been told it might not be fulfilled. I am super disappointed because I don't have the luxury of enough of a credit card balance for trial-and-error ordering this way. I don't mind a wait to receive my product, but I need accurate information about whether products are or are not available.Date of experience: September 19, 2022",1

I contacted the company and they resolved the issue quickly by refunding my money. This had to have cost the company because the shipment was a frozen delivery which isn't cheap. They were very helpful and promised to let me know when the ""Fully Cooked"" item was back in stock. I would highly recommend this company.Date of experience: September 28, 2022",5

Dave,US,"Sep 20, 2022","Very disillusioned with this companyVery disillusioned with this company. By looking on the website items are listed as in stock or waiting processing. This leads a prudent person to believe that these items are warehoused or expected to be delivered to their facilities. In truth this is a drop ship company no products are warehoused for shipping. So I’m my case they sent an email that my product I had been waiting to be stocked for some time was in stock and encouraged me to order before their supplies were exhausted. I ordered immediately waited weeks just to be emailed that due to “ supply chain issues” my order wouldn’t be filled and my money refunded. At no point did they attempt to minimize this absolute failure nor research and give me a date they could in fact fill my order. I’ll look for alternate sources going forward. If this is the direction of business in this country we are Doomed.Date of experience: September 20, 2022",1
James,GB,"Updated Sep 24, 2022","Stop Sending Your Products With Evri Please :)*edit* the company contacted me promptly regarding the delivery, they have been more than professional so have changed my 1* to 4* (knocking off a star due to the choice of delivery company) as not to reflect badly on them, however, using companies like evri for delivery who are so blatantly poor will only reflect negatively on their choice to do so… customers deserve a better service than evri can provide… the delivery finally turned up after being in the system for 7 days which is not good for cheese slices. This company has done everything they can to help, by no means do my below comments reflect on them or their product only their choice to use evri…please consider changing your choice of delivery company, that’s all I ask.Im willing to change this 1 star to a 5 star after being contacted. Poor delivery due to using evri to deliver. Using this as a way to influence their decisions over using poor delivery services as that's the only way evri will get the message. The driver ladled the item as delivery attempted while i was sat 3 meters away from the door at 7:44pm tonight... it didn't get knocked, and i have a lit up working doorbell that didn't get pressed. So now my cheese slices are sat on my evri drivers floor or in his car, because he couldn't be bothered to deliver it, and ill have to now wait 2-3 days for his wife to drop it down when she has some free time. In no way is this review a bad reflection on this business but only a reflection on their poor choice of delivery service company Evri! AVOID EVRI AT ALL COSTS PLEASE STOP USING THEM!!!!

At first I had issues with long deliveries that resulted in thawed out food. I called customer service immediately and new shipments where sent that were at least still cold when I received them. Though still thawed out. They changed the way they were delivering and beefed up the packing since then and everything I order is coming fast and still frozen solid upon arrival. I have ordered a lot of things and will keep doing so. They carry everything a person would want and so far everything but 2 items has been really good. They have been great to work with.
