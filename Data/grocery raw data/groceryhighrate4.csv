Zsofia Dadi,US,"Jan 5, 2025"," Sleep Care CapsulesThis review is for the Sleep Care capsules.   I have bouts of insomnia with anxiety especially during the Holiday madness and I needed something to help me sleep without giving me feet of clay or irritability the next day, as OTC sleep aids tend to do.  These capsules worked like a charm.  I did experience pretty vivid dreams for about the first week of use which diminished over time, but I still wake up rested and in great spirits.  Highly recommend.Date of experience: December 01, 2024",5

Becky Shepherd,US,"Jan 3, 2025","Shipping costs can be twice as much as the productI love the product but do not like to pay more for shipping than the product costs. I paid $9.75 for the lavender I orders and $9.99 for shipping. I chatted with a CS rep at the time of order. I was told there was nothing that could be done and if I want to save on shipping I should order more product. I was told I should order up to 4 lbs for the $9.99 shipping. I cannot afford to order in bulk nor do I need that much product. I order as needed. I am not willing to pay $20 for a $10 items. Going forward I will order from Amazon where I can get twice the product for almost the same cost and pay no shipping and I get it in 24 to 72 hours instead of 8+ days. The CS rep tried to convince me Amazon increases the price on all their products in order to cover shipping which is not true. We use Amazon fairly regular and even if I paid the monthly fee of $14 per month it would still be cheaper than ordering from Mountain Rose. Unfortunately I will no longer be using Mountain Rose Herbs. Since I'm not a big customer I'm sure they don't care.Date of experience: December 22, 2024",3

Lucialina Tavares,US,"Dec 26, 2024","""Disappointing Yarrow Flower Quality from Mountain Rose HerbsAs a dedicated herbalist with over a decade of experience using yarrow flower from various suppliers, I was disheartened by my recent purchase from Mountain Rose Herbs. Traditionally, yarrow flowers present a creamy to light brown hue, accompanied by a strong, distinctive aroma and a notably bitter taste. However, the batch I received was predominantly composed of finely ground green leaves, deviating significantly from the expected characteristics.Mountain Rose Herbs is renowned for its commitment to organic and sustainably sourced botanicals, as evidenced by their extensive certifications and quality control measures.  Their dedication to quality is further demonstrated by their in-house testing facilities, which ensure the identity and purity of their products.  Despite these rigorous standards, the discrepancy in the yarrow flower batch I received raises concerns about consistency and quality control.Date of experience: December 22, 2024",1

SC,US,"Sep 27, 2024Verified","THE GOOD, THE BADTHE GOOD: polite manners of staff when I called and made e-mail inquiries.  I like that the country of origin is always specified for each essential oil.  The quality of the oil seems good, though I am not a great expert, but skin reactions and ingestion were not a problem even with medium-aggressive dilution.THE BAD: order processing takes too long before it is handed to the carrier.  In addition, the shipping options were not clearly explained, in my opinion.  The distinction between USPS and the other carrier was not explicit.  In hot summers, fast delivery options must be clear lest the essential oils stay too long in delivery trucks.Maybe I should have given 4 stars rather than 3, but the devil lies in the details.Date of experience: September 05, 2024",3

Carolyn,US,"Updated Oct 15, 2024","Quality of the Hydrosols updated review I ordered three different hydrosols from Mountain Rose Herbs. Peppermint, Rose and Cucumber. Every last one of them was rank and rancid.  I was extremely disappointed. I have been ordering from Mountain Rose Herbs for quite some time. And have been a loyal customer, so I was expecting so much more from them. Obviously the hydrosols were very old and had gone rancid, but they still wanted to sell them and I was chosen to unknowingly purchase ad products.The worst part,  is their return policy. Make sure you look at their ‚Äúreturn policy before you order.‚Äù Why should I have to come out of pocket and pay to return their rancid items? I ordered so much more from them, including essential oils.  Now I am skeptical about everything I ordered, as my order was quite large and as you know, Mountain Rose is not cheap. Though the prices used to be more reasonable, I suppose they will claim inflation cost for the reason their prices have skyrocketed, even more. Don‚Äôt have a problem paying for whatever they charge, if I want the product, but at least they can be fair and send quality and fresh products.Update: Received a phone call and message from Mountain Rose and the company was gracious enough to explain that their hydrosols were ‚Äústeam-distilled pure botanical waters with a much lighter fragrance than most expect‚Äù They also do not have essential oils added to them. I was also told that I could return the items, but I realized that this would be quite pricey and not worth the extra expense or trouble. I believe their return policy is written so that the public at large can be protected. Mountain Rose has also given me a ‚Äústore credit‚Äù the amount I have paid for the hydrosols.
