KK,US,3 hours agoVerified,"Integrity shows. Worth the investment. The integrity checks out after some online research. I am investing in US Wellness Meats in an effort to avoid consuming CAFO meats . A little pricey, but just buy in bulk for a discount and free shipping. The quality of the meat is fantastic and doesn't have the ""supermarket smell"" on it while cooking.

C Young,US,"Dec 29, 2024Verified","Would recommend!Two years ago I had my firstborn and decided to go clean and holistic in my home. Up until recently, I decided to hop on the “tallow lotion” train and diy my own. I used their Grass fed and finished tallow (which is packed with better nutrients due to the lifestyle the cows are given) and sweet almond oil to create the lotion and the quality is incredible. My skin is so smooth, better than any store bought lotion has ever done for me. And has cleared up my daughter’s dry skin almost instantly with one application. If you’re looking to use their tallow outside of food, I would highly recommend, but the smell is slightly strong of beef fat.

"Dan Rockhill, Rockhill Assoc.",US,2 days agoVerified,"Years agoYears ago, the process was simple and friendly. Now that USWM has grown the process has become driven more by corporate interests than previously. It took me a day to try and get my log in accepted as it kept telling me there was problem with the system try later. If they told me my credit card needed the password updated, I would have done it immediately, but that option wasn't clear. What's the reason for two step authorization, like were in the CIA, having to go get my phone for the secret number to back up who I am? I finally placed my order on December 29th. Today is the 11th of January and I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY ORDER. Granted there was snow but hardly enough to cause such a problem. I called USWM to see if they knew FEDEX was taking so long and was put off, no one at Customer Service but a tape message saying leave a number we'll get back to you. I doubt FedEx uses anything but a heated warehouse to store deliveries they will move when they feel like it so what are the chances my order has spoiled. Sorry but you hit a raw nerve asking me how we are doing.  Dan Rockhill, and I'm only in Kansas about three hours west of Canton! Date of experience: December 30, 2024",2

The smell of cooked chicken was actually very pleasant - rather than the usual unpleasant chickeny smell permeating the home. The beef heart was the best I have ever tasted.

I get cravings for hot dogs and I really like their CLEAN hot dogs which I reordered, again, this month. Been with them for awhile now but still have more items I want to try. Their prices are pretty fair compared to the subscription sites, I think that (for myself anyway) is because I can order as little or lot, as I need (have room for). I recommend this site.

kevin,US,"Updated Nov 22, 2024Verified","gross gristle found throughout liverwurst packagesthe customer service is friendly, but strangely ""blind"" to their own need for improvement.  for example, although i love the flavor of their liverwurst, it has a HUGE amount of small and medium sized pieces of grizzle in EVERY package, some more than others.  when i pointed out how gross this is, and their need to use finer mesh screens to take these out before packaging and shipping them off, their response is:  no one else complains, and the package(s) i received must be an outlier.  when i asked them to check how many customers order liverwurst only one time (not willing to slog through the gristle), they again reiterated that this simply doesn't happen and that i am the ONLY one who has ever raised this issue with them!  i sent them photos of just how much gristle i have had to spit out or take out of my mouth in just one package as proof.   constantly having to remove gristle should be a cause of concern to their quality control department; instead the implication is that the ""problem"" lies with me and others must swallow or ignore the gristle, so they do not plan to change or improve on their QC at all!  until i find another similar organic company with better gristle screening methods for their liverwurst, i will still order from them......but i won't dare serve it to visiting friends or family members.  in response to your assessment that it is ""only"" naturally occurring hard pieces, what difference does this make if they are literally unchewable?  they should not be in there in the first place. if i knew how to attach a photo i would do so, just to give other customers some idea of the number and size these unscreened ""pieces"" of whatever that i have to spit out of a typical 1lb container.Date of experience: November 04, 2024",3
