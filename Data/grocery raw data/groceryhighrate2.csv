Nancy C Jacobson,US,20 hours agoVerified,"Great, pleasant service fixing a mistakeI ordered a 12-pack of Honeybells for my brother in Tennessee right before Christmas. The shipment got there in time for Christmas, but in the crush of last minute orders like mine, they sent him grapefruits % naval oranges. When I learned that and called, the Hale Groves rep was very apologetic and said a 12-pack of Honeybells would be sent at no additional cost. True to their word, the 12-pack of Honeybells arrived at my brother's short time later.Date of experience: December 20, 2024",5

For this years order for Fitzgerald/Hess I notified FedEx to change delivery address they advised that request needed to come from Hale Groves.  I contacted HG and provided the new address for them to notify FedEx.   I was assured it would be taken care of as it hadn’t been delivered as of yet.   I spoke with my friend only to find out she had not received the order.  I called back HG and then was advised the oranges were already delivered to the previous address and not the new address.    I was disappointed to hear this as I was assured it would be delivered to the new address, same town but different street address.   I expressed my disappointment and asked if something could be done.  I was advised a new order could be sent out but I would have to pay another $35 or so dollars.  Over the years I have purchased quite a few gifts thru HG and thought as a courtesy something could be complimentary sent but this was not the case.  Needless to say I was very disappointed and will think twice about any further orders.Thank you.

James Rodgers,US,5 days agoVerified,"Lack of concern for issues and mistakesWe have been ordering from your company…We have been ordering from your company for a few years.  Last year we tried your bulk grapefruit and were very dissapointed. The grapefruit we get in the grocery store is fresher and stays good longer.  One of the gift boxes we sent was supposed to have 3 grapefruit and only had one.  This year I tries to order on line and kept getting to the point of confirming addresses and delivery dates. I would get the first one done fine and kept freezing up when I tried to do the second address and delivery date.  So I waited and called to talk to a sales person.  I explained to them the problem I was having with the web site.  The apologized but didn't seem very interested in correcting the issue.  So I placed my 2 orders. The second order the delivery date needed to be changed to receive by Christmas.  I asked her twice to make sure that it had been changed.  She assured me it would get there by Christmas.  It DIDN'T@!!@@!@! I called in to make sure the order had been placed and the delivery date had been changed. The delivery date hadn't been changed.  It got there on time according to the old delivery date.  These relatives travel for the holidays. I want the fruit to get there when they are home and can enjoy it.  Luckily they were still home but I was very upset when they didn't have their gift for Christmas or even New Years!!!!The person I talked to when I called to see what was wrong seemed very unconcerned that there was a problem. I realize according to the computer there was no problem but there was.  After explaining the problem and expressing our frustration there was still no apology. When I more firmly told him I wasn't pleased with the service he did finally apologize half heartedly.  I know you must do a huge volume of orders during the holidays.  Mistakes happen.  We didn't complain last year with the poor quality and missing fruit.  The only reason I called in this year was to make sure that the gift would finally arrive.If problems like this occur I would suggest that the personel be more apologetic even if they think the error is the customers. Other businesses sometimes offer a gift/discount coupon/freebee as a goodwill gesture.  I think the thing that most irritated me was the lack of concern that was shown when I mentioned the website issue and the lack of concern with our gift being sent late. We like the product and selection you offer but if we keep having issues we will be forced to look elsewhere.Date of experience: December 09, 2024",3

I sent an e-mail complaint the next day, and I have yet to hear back as to whether you are going to rectify it.  So I never even alerted your company of the poor packing done in my Grandson's shipment. The tin of nuts was just loose inside the box, so while the box looked good on the outside, the contents were scattered all over inside (evidently from being tossed around) and had to be scooped up from inside the shipping box - probably not to sanitary.  Probably will not use your service again.Date of experience: December 18, 2024",1
