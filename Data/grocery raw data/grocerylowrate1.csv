Christopher Dale,PR,6 days ago,"Walmart grocery delivery is a scam. Walmart order on a Sunday. They put it off until Tuesday and guaranteed DELIVERY between 10-12.  Never arrived and after 3pm when contacted, they guaranteed a driver just left with groceries.  100% lie. Waited over 8 hours for groceries never even attempted delivery.  They play intentional games when you call in. Worst customer service I've ever experienced.  Put on hold for 15-20 minutes at a time.  THE WALMART GROCERY DELIVERY IS A COMPLETE SCAM.

Christine Sappington,US,2 days ago,"Customers beware Customers beware. I have been getting Walmart delivery now for about 3 years and I just found out it's not even through Walmart. It's through a third party company, so when you're ordering online and you think that these Walmart workers are coming to your home, it is not. Walmart is a third party company that Walmart has hired has no affiliation with. Who's coming out to your home. I looked up the company online.All you have to do is have a driver's license and a vehicle.They're not doing background checks or anything, and they're giving them your information.This is ridiculous.BewareThey're giving out your information to a third party company that you are not aware of when you get delivery.It is not from walmart is from a third party company.All your orders are all your information.Your home address your phone number and everything is being released to this third party company and that is exactly why so many orders are messed up, it's not even through Walmart. If you call pick up, they will tell you that it's not even through them that they don't even they can see that you made order, but it's another company that's actually coming. In the store, doing the shopping paying for it delivering it to your home. They have no control of it even. This is ridiculous.I've been shopping with them for how long they've never even told me this.I'm just now aware of it.It is ridiculous beware that they're giving your information out to a total different third party company that they have no affiliation withDate of experience: January 10, 2025",1

This is just the latest issue with walmart delivery. Ordering items for a meal and having to wait to see what actually shows up; being told something is not available and going into the store only to find it fully stocked with that item; and, getting produce items that look like they were in the clearance bin, are just a few of the ongoing issues.

The driver canceled the order because she was incompetent and couldn't find us. I was out smoking a cigarette ten minutes before the delivery time scheduled, and when the app said it was on the way. I even stayed outside an extra ten minutes, during which it was canceled. Not even one car passed by, so she never even tried. I then contacted Walmart and asked if I could just come pick it up, and they said no, and I couldn't reorder until the next day. They said they canceled the order but didn't, and it showed pending.The next day, I contacted them again through the chat option, and they said they canceled it and I should get an email. I went around and around with them about the app and refund, not showing the cancelation that took place. The next day, they said the same thing, but again, neither took place. The next day, I contacted them again through chat, trying to get a resolution with no success. Later that day, I got a partial refund, but the app said pending. So I contacted them again, and they said it's pending due to two items being out of stock. What!? Two items I never received on a canceled order. The chat agent that time was either new or could care less because he ended the chat before a resolution or explanation was given.This was day six and I was more than furious so I called to talk to someone hoping they weren't completely incompetent like the driver and last few employers I had talked to that lied to me. Wrong. He was as incompetent as they were. He told me there was nothing he could do and he couldn't refund the rest of the money which was thirty dollars and change and that it was the driver's fault, not there's. NO! The driver is contracted from Walmart, not me, and going by what he said, they just stole thirty dollars from me, and there was nothing that could be done. I told him I wanted my money back or products in not so nice words. I requested to talk to a supervisor, and that's when he said he would refund other items equal to the amount not refunded. Then I get the refund, and it's like sixteen dollars, and the app still says pending. This isn't the first time this has happened, and our order has been missing items paid for several times. They always crush our bread, too. What they have as a service for convenience is exactly the opposite, not worth it, and a clown show. If you can avoid delivery service, do it. Otherwise, get ready for failures and poor customer service to make it right. Date of experience: December 20, 2024",1

After placing the order, I immediately received an email stating the order was canceled. After speaking to two different representatives, the order was canceled because the method of payment changed. the issue would need to be escalated and take up to 24-48 hours. I was told this was to protect my account. This all could have been avoided if I was alerted on the checkout page or notified by text messaging that I made a change to my account. Instead, it appears they have a low-tech company or an automated process in place that immediately cancels your order instead of notifying you, the account holder.Date of experience: October 20, 2024",1

Walmart needs to start putting cameras on these people doing deliveries. Maybe that will put a stop to the trouble that lots of people have had. It seems like it doesn't matter to the drivers if a person doesn't get their delivery or not!Walmart has a lot of changes they need to make, if they're willing to do so, to improve this problem.

( oh just make noise and they will run away, they are more afraid of you ) Said they would call back when they knocked on her door. Never did.  We are so frustrated.

Warin,SE,"Updated Sep 13, 2023","Once Upon A Time In AmericaI'm 68 years old. Once upon a time in America, businesses used to compete regarding who gave the best service.  In the 1960s someone came up with the idea of scrapping service attendants and making customers pump their own gas.  That turned out to yield more profit. Walmart has taken this concept to the extreme.  Not only have they done away with at first the baggers and then the checkers. They've outsourced deliveries AND customer service agents.  Walmart is a billion dollar company. They could afford to give MUCH better service.  But that would reduce profits. IMHO, they're greedy to the max.  Nevertheless, THAT'S why their service sucks.  LOWER SERVICE = HIGHER PROFITS.TIP: Use PayPal.  Never give Walmart your credit card information.  If you need a refund and Walmart tries to rip you off, you can complain to PayPal and they will retrieve your money. If you have already given Walmart your credit card data, go to the website and delete your card from their files.Date of experience: August 28, 2023",1

One such comment was, ‚ÄúYou know you can always go pick up your groceries.‚Äù  as a Walmart plus subscriber one might think it was a service I paid for so why would I pay for delivery service if I wanted to pick up my groceries.  It‚Äôs THIS lack of professionalism that gives them NEGATIVE 5 STARS!  Do NOT do business with this service as they are completely unethical and without professionalism to get the job done correctly which basically equates that they do NOT value their customers.  I will be canceling my Walmartplus membership ASAP.Date of experience: February 03, 2023",1

I have had orders delivered to wrong house and Walmart did NOTHING, no refund because there was a picture (even though that day I also had a successful delivery and the 2 pictures didn't match at all). I have had items not delivered (they did refund), issues with delivery driver (she nearly started a huge fight with neighbors/cars, and egged it on instead of being professional-lasted 10 minutes. Ended when I went outside to see what all the yelling was about. I live in a quiet middle class neighborhood.) as well as delayed packages and when I tried to cancel since I needed it ASAP, they wouldn't let me cancel and wouldn't give me a new ETA. I just find that Walmart doesn't care at all about their customers. Compared to Amazon Prime where I always get a successful resolution to problems/issues. I have experienced all this within my 30 day trial. I would love to subscribe, but the issues are just too great. So sad. I am old enough to remember when Walmart first started and their focus was on customers and a great experience. Now they have gone the way of Kmart. Walmart - you can't compete with Amazon with this type of service. I really wanted to get away from Amazon (due to slave-like labor) but I guess not.Date of experience: February 01, 2023",2
Lois Grissom,US,"Feb 27, 2024"," Delivery service stinksI marked on my Kroger grocery delivery instructions to leave grocery‚Äôs at back door where my apartment is. The front door is landlords. There is a large note at the front door saying DO NOT leave groceries here. Leave at back door. But they leave my groceries at the front door 99 % of time. Which causes a lot of problems as I can barely get around.  When this happens I remove the tip.  Now I have trouble even getting them to deliver period.  I call Walmart and complain but nothing changes.  In fact now they leave groceries with item spilled out etc. I think they must think I am putting tips on then removing after I get my stuff!!!  Not true. But I won‚Äôt tip when I have to go get them. Walmart says u can cancel your delivery subscription but if u do u do not get a penny back.

They didn‚Äôt have the size and substituted with a different size but same brand and type. Get home and the cat food isn‚Äôt there. Call the store to come back and pick it up and of course no one picks up. Call customer service who says they‚Äôre busy serving others their orders which is likely why they aren‚Äôt answering (but they failed to get me all my items) so only option was refund which takes like 5-7 business days.

Walmart REFUSED to refund my money. It's response was: We delivered the items. Duh! The company should be investigated by the Board of Health as much of the food I received had to be thrown away.. And, I was a Walmart Plus Member  and asked to have the balance of my membership fee ($100) refunded and the request was refused even though my membership just began at the end of May 2023. FYI -- if you complain or return items, Walmart will cancel your account. This is how the company deals with its own issues -- using Doordash to deliver the food you ordered and using off shore customer service reps who cannot speak or understand English, making it impossible for customers to get refunds.

I am in the extended 2 hour window AGAIN right now for today's order and not hopeful. I guess it is my own fault for trying again. My advice, don't waste your time or money on the monthly delivery subscription.  They have no problem leaving you high and dry. I needed those items today. Now tomorrow I will be going to another grocery store to get what I need. Sometimes it is not all about price and in this instance, definitely not about convenience.

When I got .com on the phone they told me their was nothing they could do (LIE) and told me to go back to the store and talk to the manager. When doing so, the manager found the cart of bagged items in the back.  Another time I parked and waited and waited for an hour while seeing employees come out with carts to serve others waiting.  I looked at the mobile app and saw that they said I had picked up my groceries a half hour earlier.  I called .com and said I had not been given my groceries and they can check their cameras to see I was telling the truth and no one had ever approached my car.  After suffering them treating me like I was trying to get free groceries and they doubted that happened, they FINALLY refunded my card for over $200.

As a result, we lost clients and had chargebacks in excess of $9,000 from disgruntled airbnb clients who required the items when promised and ultimately walked out on the reservation when items promised did not arrive.  Even when items were in stock, drivers often just don't show up and leave the order in limbo for days beyond before automatically canceling the order.  There is no way to communicate with the driver and when you speak with Walmart support, they speak from a script and make false promises that do not get fulfilled. There is a reason everyone opts for Amazon....  But for same day delivery this was our only perceived option, which backfired in a massive way.Date of experience: February 17, 2023",1

Elizabeth Nudd Edens,US,"Mar 17, 2023","I have recently experienced what I can‚Ä¶I have recently experienced what I can only call a serious bait and switch operation when ordering groceries via store delivery or InHome from Walmart.It revolves around one product that I have been ordering regularly for 3 years.The Fancy Feast Filet Mignon dry cat food comes in 2 sized at Walmart. A 3 lb bag for $9.00 and a 7 lb bag for $16.98. When I ordered a 7 lb bag, I received a text saying it would be shipped rather than via delivery. That was no problem, litter is often switched as well. However, the delivery was a 3lb bag at a cost of $22.00 instead of the 7lb bag ordered, for $16.98.When I went back and reviewed my actual order, sure enough, it showed up as 7lb on the order, but 3lb in the cart! I had to ship it back with a printed label, but did get a refund.Yesterday I ordered another 7lb bag via InHome and that is what showed up in the cart. But an hour later, when adding to my order, sure enough, the cart then showed the 3lb size at the higher price! I cancelled the order. To see if this was merely a glitch, I ordered again today, this time 2 - 7lb bags and within an hour, the email confirmation for the placed order switched the 2 - 7lb bags to 2 - 3lb bags, but at the price of 2 - 7lb bags to be delivered. 3 times is not a glitch, it is an intentional switch-and-bait. This means that if I continue to order from Walmart, I will have no choice but to recheck the order an hour or so after receiving confirmation and go through it item by item checking prices and weight.Needless to say, I will simply stop purchasing from Walmart . I have no idea how many other items I have paid a higher price for, than I originally ordered. This is a very grave concern and I have tried to reach the store, to no avail. They simply don't answer the phone. I will try the corporation next.Best advice? DO NOT TRUST WALMART ONLINE GROCERY ORDERING. Amazon Fresh is a safer option.Date of experience: March 09, 2023",1

It‚Äôs completely unreliable; their instructions always both confusing and contradictory,¬†I drove 15 miles in a blizzard because I received notification that Walmart had ¬†made a delivery early. ¬†There are no tire tracks on my street, nor were there humans tracks. There was no delivery ¬† It‚Äôs very confusing about what they were supposed to deliver and what was canceled and apparently nothing was delivered.¬†I received notification that my orders were being shipped early ¬† ¬†Then I received notification that my items were on the way! ¬†None of the dates they gave me were correct ¬†and then I received notification that my items had been delivered . ¬†What are the items that are early ? ¬†What are the items delayed ? ¬†What items were on their way ? I told them that nothing was delivered that day, and then the reply was. ... what items weren't delivered?The problem with this is eyed orders of a few hundred dollars worth of things. There were a bunch of items and I had no idea what your schedule was and apparently they didn't either. So I repeated to them again they were items on a specific day. On the surface this service seems very exciting ... we are told that Walmart will deliver everything for free but they‚Äôll charge me at least a ¬†7 to $10 tip without permission. It's not free and this is misleading   I was charged seven dollars for a tip ¬†‚Ä¶.I didn‚Äôt receive anything.  The items were delivered altogether and I was charged a $7 tip for each delivery.¬†¬† ¬†if Walmart delivery worked the way it‚Äôs supposed to work it would be wonderful; but as it is, it‚Äôs totally unreliable ¬†The delivery and instructions are often a violation of common sense and rationality ¬† I ¬†have a security fence area. They could‚Äôve tossed ¬†the light items inside where people couldn‚Äôt reach it; ¬†but they leave it right by the sidewalk where people can steal it. It makes absolutely no sense. ¬†Sometimes they make the delivery and sometimes they don't. You have to look and you don't know if you find anything.   Not all the deliveries are bad I do have some where they will put the object in a place they won't easily be stolen.... but they also plays at where someone can just reach down from the sidewalk and grab it Of course, there are a lot of alternatives to Walmart and I can see why some people don't like Walmart.  Walmart has really great prices, but when your charge some thing and you don't receive it, it's not a great price  In many cases, really bad labor. ¬†In times like these it‚Äôs understandable but the notices Walmart sends are always contradictory and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to get. ¬†It‚Äôs just pure chaos and this worry creates stress ... it's very disturbing I was also told several hours after the items were supposedly delivered that they were delivered but then it turned out that they weren‚Äôt delivered. ¬†I found myself walking around in the cold in the dark looking for packages that weren't there. I would not use the service if I were you. I hope people start going to the alternative stores who offer a better service and maybe Walmart will improve.Date of experience: January 18, 2023",1
Teresa. Wells,US,"Jul 30, 2023","Does Walmart make more $$ not delivering what they promise?I tried the grocery delivery again after having a successful experience or 2 - a rarity, I promise. First off, it you don't tip 15%, you likely won't even receive your order. They will tell you it's delayed...and delayed...and that your only recourse is to cancel it and get a refund. But if you use a debit or credit card (how else can you order from them online?), you will WAIT for your $$ for up to 10 days! If you are a senior on a fixed income like me and you have no extra money lying around, you will just have to go hungry. This happens more times than not, but again, if like me, you paid the annual fee for free delivery and can't afford to use a different store, you have no choice because they stopped giving refunds for Walmart+ no matter how many times they don't do what you paid for. Tonight, I expected an order between 6 and 7 pm that I asked to sign for, but a knock on the door never came. I open the door to see about 18 bags of groceries there that did not belong to me. I ask to sign because this has happened before - more than once. I start online, go through the prompts to have someone call me. Of course they cannot help me, they can't call the driver because they don't have the number, but I can keep the wrong  groceries,  cancel, and get a refund -  of cours, in 10 DAYS!!!  I explain I have a broken foot, am 67, and am quite ill, that it was going to be difficult to bring in all that food in my condition, that I have no money to reorder until I get my refund, and that this happens all the time and that I'm so frustrated I'm now ready to cry. She says call the store, maybe they can find the driver. I call the store and surprise! they don't have a way to reach him either and I will have to call the 800 number which I explain I already talked to. She says she can't help. I call the 800 number back. That person says there is nothing she can do about any of it. I make her reach out to someone higher up who says there is no mechanism for them to do anything. So, I dragged in and back out (with my broken foot and oxygen) a whole bunch of food  I'm sure someone really needed. Lots of chicken  and more that would've spoiled and that I had no room for in an apartment size refrigerator. Neighbors came to take what they could. I get a text from Walmart saying ""Good news! We initiated your refund"" which takes a week and a half. The audacity and insensitivity of that text makes me really sad and really angry. Walmart does not even seem to be trying to correct all the issues with grocery delivery and I'm left wondering if they make more money with the annual fees they won't refund and with all the cancelled orders they have use of the funds to earn money on. I used to be in banking and can well guess how much they make in just a 24 hour period with our money. It's unconscionable how Walmart  mistreats their customers, especially those with limited resources. Shame on them! And shame on me for trusting the Walmart name and not checking out review sites other than theirs before paying that annual fee. This has been going on for months and months and months and it doesn't matter much where you are in parts of N FL or which store you order from. I write positive reviews for almost everyone with whom I do business so it distresses me to write what I have about Walmart +, but people must be warned if they depend on them to bring them something as essential as their groceries :(Date of experience: July 28, 2023",1

The refund ( only part of the problem) was purposely given for a ""lessor amount""... error by accident. Place an online order as I have done a number of times over the last couple of years.  Delivery instructions requested that the order (as always) should be dropped off in front of my garage and only after they had texted just prior to dropping it off. The order was delivered to my old address, even though my account clearly shows only my new address.  No text was sent prior to delivery to the ‚Äúwrong address‚Äù.  It was dropped off outside the service window we were required to fill out.They blocked the driveway of my old house with the order‚Ä¶   so the new owners of the house called me and asked what ‚ÄúI‚Äù Was going to do about it.The local store was called and they said they could do ‚Äúnothing‚Äù ‚Ä¶ that I would have to call Customer Service.  They indicated that they will not not call their  own ‚ÄúWalmart Customer Service‚Äù , but I must call another number and wait for someone to pick up and speak with them ourselves.I called your ‚ÄúCustomer Service dept‚Äù and Customer Service stated they could do nothing about the order they dropped off and‚Ä¶ that the most they could do was give me a refund.  They lied about not having the resources to have the items picked up, they said it was Walmart's Policy to just leave it there‚Ä¶ even if it is blocking someones driveway.Customer Service is farmed out to another country, and even from another country‚Ä¶ they lies and said they do not have the resources in my area t pick up a mis-delivered order.  Or, even move it.Their ( Customer Service outside the USA) gives misinformation to the customer, and the customer likely either is believed by the naive or accepted out of complete exasperation.A list of errors:1. Deliver to the wrong address2.Local store cannot take care of problem3.Local store will not take care of the problem for the customer, but pushed customer Into the unpredictable ‚ÄúCustomer Service Department‚Äù where lies or misinformationmanned by personnel from another country are given scripts for various issues with very littleauthority to actually take care of the problem properly.4. Refund purposely given for a lessor amount to cheat the customerThe beginning of the problem is that when a customer visits and logs in, the address is loaded into memory so that it can be used for delivery and identification when needed.  However, when an address Is changed during the same sign-in---  the programmer forgot to clear the memory location of the old address info and replace with the current info.  That is how the account shows the new address , but the info sent to the delivery personnel show only old info.  ( The order was placed after the sign -n and new address edit ).The balance of the errors are Walmart Policies and/or the perceived understanding of them..  along with‚Ä¶. an overworked and under trained management‚Ä¶which management has  little or no business foresight.The policies of Walmart and the software of Walmart used to be ‚Äústate of the art‚Äù ‚Ä¶ now Walmart is regressing and will never catch up to companies like Amazon‚Ä¶ in software or insightful business policies/plan.   Hello Amazon and companies like them.... Walmart will soon be gone.Date of experience: September 11, 2022",1

Melissa,US,"Aug 23, 2022","Run Away!!!In northern VA - Run - Run - Run Away!  Cancelled my W+ membership last night (8/22/22). Signed up for membership several months ago and at first there was no issues with my grocery delivery orders then in May 2022 my grocery order was mysteriously delayed with no explanation or ETA when it might be delivered.  Tried calling the Wal-Mart store that was fulfilling order but no one will answer the phone - EVER!  I had to cancel order. I tried to place the order again 2 days later and this time it was delivered.In mid May became very ill and couldn't leave my house (no, it wasn't Covid) but for the rest of May, June and July of 2022 my grocery delivery orders arrived without issue.  Starting in Aug, Aug 7th to be exact , my grocery order was delayed again but no explanation as to why or when it might be delivered so had to cancel the order.  I tried to get that same order re-delivered on Aug 11 and again, during the time it was to be delivered I get another delay message and you guessed it, no indication as to what happened or when the order might be delivered so had to cancel that order.  Finally, yesterday, on August 22, I called to speak to some at the Help Center and this person said he would give me a Promo of $15 and to give it another try.  So I decided that 'just one more time' I'll try and place an order for the 3rd time so I placed the order around noon on Sun (to be delivered between 6 & 7 PM) and when I check the order status it shows it's still being prepared.  By 6:40 PM I receive a notification of order delayed and no explanation or new ETA when or if order would arrive.  I call the Help Center and tell this person that 3 times in a row this month my grocery orders are getting delayed with no explanation or any new delivery time.  The Help person looks into the order and sees that the Delivery driver cancelled the delivery.  How is that even allowed???  I told the Help person I had tried to call that store a couple times but no one will ever answer the phone.  I told the Help person at this point to cancel my membership and that I also wanted a refund of my Aug membership fee of $12.95 so he said he'd do both plus escalate the issue to this particular store.So my guess is that these drivers shop around to see where they can get the biggest tip on a delivery and arbitrarily cancel any other grocery delivery order they don't want to take but I told the Help person that these drivers should never even have the option to cancel a delivery order.  Also, I told the Help person that for my yearly Amazon membership includes delivery with no tip needed and I've always received my Amazon deliveries without ever an issue so no more wasting my time with WalMart.  I'm done, done, done!!!!Date of experience: August 23, 2022",1

snoofle yumyum,US,"Aug 5, 2022","For the first few months it was GREAT‚Ä¶For the first few months it was GREAT and very convenient for a family that has no transportation or friends to help out. I am also diabetic and low income so it was helpful to have same day delivery of affordable healthy foods. Also we‚Äôre on a budget and fixed income. So at first this made sense, as we were saving a TON of money compared to the places in walking distance that sold groceries. Then over the last 6 wks or so things have been very weird. First we started having issues with billing. The pre Auth would drop off days later and not be finalized. Then a final total would come out a week later. Which can be confusing if u don‚Äôt notice it. Then I started having things double charged and random smaller charges that I had not authorized coming out. I have had to file THREE(3),yes..THREE(3) disputes for charges in the last two weeks with my bank as walmart would not refund. Most recently, the straw that broke the back, was an order completed at 2 pm and paid for. It was pulled, completed and waiting to be delivered. However it was never delivered. I spoke w someone at the location that said they couldn‚Äôt do anything with it u til the online order was reinitiated. However no one could take the order off of hold ether at the store or at the customer service center. I finally spoke w someone forthcoming at the cs center he told me that they have control at the store level once the order has been submitted. He also told me there has been a slew of recent complaints that are similar in regards to billing and non delivery. I have now cancelled my monthly subscription to W+. I‚Äôll no longer use them and am going to go ahead and start using Instacart as we often need food delivered per our situation.

Walmart does not care about you and as a 1000 pound gorilla, they do exactly what they want. I am handicapped and I recently started using the grocery pickup service. Sunday, July 17th, I arrived for a pickup order. I followed instructions and waited and waited. I started feeling unwell so I went back home, 1 mile, for a few minutes and came back. I waited 1 hour and still no groceries. I talked to someone at corporate customer service and got a refund. I had to go in the store to get 2 items I really needed. I almost collapsed becasue I should not have been walking in the store on that day. That's what I thought grocery pickup was for! This store at Montfort/Dallas has a long history of problems and no one was answering any phones at any extension on that day. 10 minutes after I arrived in the parking spot I received a text message that order had been picked up. I've seen that before, every time I have used grocery pickup. It's a lie. Never received any groceries at all in 1 hour of waiting. I will say that the corporate customer service rep was helpful and processed a refund. What about delivery?  Walmart's delivery is a joke - been there , done that. Walmart delivery is the worst of the worst. The only positive department at Monfort store is the pharmacy - always efficient and courteus.

Mikki Barrett,US,"Jul 17, 2022","WALMART IMPLEMENT CHANGES PLEASEI have been ordering groceries online from Walmart intermittently for about 4 years now. My orders have been intermittent because of the service. I try the Walmart+ program then become dissatisfied, stop it and then try it again later in hopes that improvements have been made. There are many positives to online ordering from Walmart: Prices are the same as in store, I can order anytime 24/7, product selection is fairly good and most importantly to me, I save a great deal of time. Recently, the cons are outweighing the pros though: Items are being substituted when I requested they be excluded from substitution, i.e., I requested Star ham salad and received chicken salad instead (chicken and ham salad are not even similar), quite a few products are not available but are listed on the site, and delivery is often shoddy because they use other delivery services. I have had deliveries that have never arrived and conversations with drivers who have been incredibly rude.  Today, I had to request a refund for an inappropriate substitution and was informed that now Walmart is offering InHome delivery provided by their employees who will put your food away in your kitchen.   In theory this is great but they also are charging an additional $7 a month to do this bringing the cost to $138 a year for the service AND you still have to make a purchase of $35 for them to deliver free. As a single woman who is not cooking for a family, I prefer fresh produce and other foods that are not shelf stable which requires I shop more frequently, sometimes 4-5 days a week.  Requiring that I spend $35 to have these products delivered free every time is cost prohibitive. I generally spend in the neighborhood of $15-$20 for the ""quick shops"" and buy shelf stable items a couple of times a month so basically I'm ordering from Walmart 2 times a month and personally shopping about 12 times a month at a local market close by.  That's an additional   $75-$100 weekly that could be used at Walmart if they did't have a $35 minimum purchase! I applaud Walmart for starting their InHome service but they need to drop the minimum purchase requirement before I would consider paying them an additional $7 a month.Date of experience: July 17, 2022",2

I have used 2 other supermarket's apps for pick-up and become furious (these other apps throw out your pick-up day and time as punishment for adding or changing anything!!).

Mrs J McG,US,"Updated May 25, 2022","Beware. Don‚Äôt trust Walmart online grocery delivery order 5-22-22On 5-22-22 I placed an online grocery order and selected a delivery time between 12-1pm. The order was for 8 items which included a $7.95 fee for delivery. The groceries were purchased for an elderly relative who is a shut in and who recently had surgery. This time frame came and went without a delivery. I did receive an alert on my Walmart app that it was delayed. I made several calls to the Neptune,NJ store, but no one ever answered the phone that day, I tried calling the store again on Monday, 5-23-22 and the associate who answered the phone never even asked me for my name or order #, then rudely snapped at me and said ‚ÄúI told you to call the number I gave you!‚Äù I politely told her that I had not yet spoke to anyone, then she replied ‚ÄúWell you sound just like another woman who just called‚Äù. I then called the new # she gave me and the associate told me the order was ‚Äúready‚Äù and should be delivered by noon that day (Monday). We‚Äôll that time frame came and went without any grocery delivery. I then called went online at Walmart Customer Care Center. I gave them my info again and explained my situation to them. They put me on hold and tried to call the store themselves. She apologized to me because she was also not able to get through to the store either, so she gave me a $5 promo on a future order and told me to please be patient. I waited all day Monday and again no groceries. So then I called the 1-800 # for help. Again, the Customer Care helper could not get through to the store. They filed a formal complaint and asked me several times to cancel the order. I told them no, please do not cancel the order that these groceries were important for an elderly women without food. They told me they would assign a 3rd party driver because it was listed as ‚Äúlost in transit‚Äù. Day 3 - Tuesday 5-24-22 still no groceries so I called back again. So frustrating. This time the women who answered the call at the local Neptune, NJ store said she had no computer so she could not look it up and had to take my order # and name and she would get back to me. Apparently she took it upon herself to just cancel my grocery order. Her solution to a problem delivery was to cancel my order after I specifically told this woman and everyone I spoke to at Walmart for the past 3 days that I needed the groceries for an elderly shut in and I did not want to cancel, but apparently this was how they got rid of their delivery driver problem! Walmart canceled my order without my consent, If Walmart can‚Äôt do the job, they should not offer the delivery service! I am very disappointed by this experience.

Kittycat,US,"Apr 28, 2022","I had been an online grocery delivery‚Ä¶I had been an online grocery delivery order customer for almost 2 years this year and there were many times when I had ordered a large order and some items I payed for were missing, one time they delivered 2 big boxes of cereal boxes I didn't even order while other items were missing! I complained to Walmart.com customer service many times and I was always given a refund, I even asked them to pass my complaint to their corporate office and had the reference number emailed to me. Now things got much worse, two weeks ago I had scheduled for a delivery of a large grocery order for 6-7pm,and my instructions were always on the site for them to call me 5 minutes before they arrive so I can go down and put a bag between the outside building because the intercoms are always broken, I don't want any contact because of Covid-19,so I then need them to come up and bring my items inside and place them on my tables and or couch because I have a very bad painful back condition and I really can't life heavy bags and bend over and I'm on the third last floor of my apartment complex and  I always give them a 20$ tip for large orders like these and in the past I was really lucky to have very kind good delivery people from Walmart who did bring all of my large amount of groceries and even place them inside on my tables and couch.  After the second recent time that they never called and didn't deliver my order, a young woman from Walmart called me  2 days later after I had complained to customer service, and she asked me if I still wanted them to deliver my order and told me they are short staffed at this store, I told her that I had already canceled the order. Well they never called me and I waited and waited and they never delivered my order, so I re-scheduled for 2 days later and they did the same thing again! It only said on their web site that my order was delayed, after they did this the second time I called up customer service and said to cancel my order and give me a refund which they did. Two days before, the first time this happened a guy only delivered the cereal box I ordered and a few non perishable items were shipped for both orders. Last night was the last straw, I gave them one last chance and placed a very large grocery order and a few non grocery items to be delivered between 6-7 pm, they never called me again and didn't deliver my order and around 11 am the next day my next door neighbor rang my bell and told me that a lot of grocery bags were left outside and there were a lot of items that needed to be frozen and refrigerated so they were ruined, I don't even know how long they were left outside and it was 70 degrees this day! My neighbor was very nice enough to bring the non perishable items up to me and throw out all of the perishable items.  I called customer service and the agent gave me a refund but she also said that's really weird because on her end it doesn't even say it was delivered it says it was being prepared and had been delayed, and on my end the site and an email from them the day before said just delayed, no other information was provided.A couple of months before these incidents a very nice helpful delivery guy told me when I told him that some items I ordered were missing again, that it's Walmart you can't expect that much, and he said they have poor customer service, and he also told me that he was left waiting in their parking lot once for two hours before he was able to get the customer's groceries and deliver them!  I looked up reviews for this store location and sure enough a guy Stu had the same thing happen to him, they never called him or delivered his online order three times and he said he didn't even get a phone call or follow up email and he said avoid it at all costs unless you feel like wasting hours on the phone getting transferred multiple times to get a refund and he put 3 !!!

Waited a week for a notice for Fed ex to pick up the bike, when I called on Friday the representative just said that there was a note but never placed the Fed ex order.

Support's only solution is to cancel the order and have me reorder everything (ridiculous). I'm over it. Will never be using Walmart again and will take all of my business elsewhere. The low costs are not worth the abysmal customer support, both in store and online.Date of experience: January 18, 2022",1
Bob Curmudgeon,US,"Jan 12, 2022","Curbside Pick-upRE Cottonwood Mall's WallyMart in Albuquerque, NM: Given I have most Covid vulnerabilities and per nudging by Kids, I succumbed to doing CurbSide at least 6 months ago, about 2X/mo, and especially since Masks have cut down on OPs for in-store flirting! [E.g. I used to hang in the frozen meal aisle pretending to try to understand the directions till some gal would invariable offer to take me home for a home-cooked meal!]From parking to bluetooth-verifying what Numbered slot I picked and until my trunk closes, maybe 5-7 minutes max of contactless grocery shopping. CurbSide""Kids"" have always been cordial and made sure¬†I am for whom the order is. Greatly appreciated is my impression that they take the time/effort to get me the farthest Sell-By dates for e.g. milk, bakery goods, veggies that they can as well as bag and stow stuff properly. Walmart policy is No Tipping. They have the added convenience of being able to create an online shopping list that can be added to anytime and keep an almost¬†waitless¬†flow for pickup by using appointment¬†times for that. Out of about at least 200 items if not¬†more, I just recently had one mistake...Geesh, even I have not paid attention and grabbed the wrong item or ordered the¬†wrong size! And that...is from where my 5 Stars come.Date of experience: January 12, 2022",5
Craig,CA,"Jan 12, 2022","Finally have given up.Finally have given up.Missed orders.  Inappropriate substitutions or products simply omitted.   Today, at 9pm, and having called for updates on our 4pm delivery twice, put on hold multiple times.  We have now been told that the driver's van had an issue.  Our order is canceled.  Unable to issue a refund unless I call again tomorrow.  Do not subject yourself to this aggravation.Date of experience: January 12, 2022",1
Staci k,US,"Jan 11, 2022","Terrible service, poor communicationI cancelled my grocery membership.  The service was okay for awhile, but has been horrible for several months.  Some of my orders never showed up during the scheduled time with no communication. When I called, I was told different stories about when the order would arrive and then they were cancelled by Walmart with no communication.  Then, delivery times started being booked 2 or 3 days out.  What good is an annual membership for free delivery when one can‚Äôt even get delivery most of the time?Date of experience: January 11, 2022",1
