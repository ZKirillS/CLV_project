They were all messed up looking. They also did not taste good. After reaching out to the company, they gave me a really hard time about getting a refund For the sunflower seeds. They even went as far to claim that this is normal for organic sunflower seeds. I’ve been buying organic sunflower seeds for a long time and they’ve never looked or tasted like this. Most of the dry goods have been good from them. But I will definitely think twice about ordering nuts or seeds from them after this last experience.Date of experience: November 27, 2024",1

stephanie arnaud,US,5 days agoVerified,"The best Beef we've ever had! Thank you Reserve MeatsI had ordered the select cuts box from reserve meats, when it arrived it wasn't exactly what i had expected so I called reserve meats and talked to Joe. The butcher/packager they hired had screwed up a lot of their orders  so they were in the process of fixing that problem. Joe felt awful about the mix-ups and insisted on making it right with us even though I wasn't asking for anything at all. The quality is amazing, My cowboy husband says its the best tasting meat he has eaten and is now our go-to for red meat. I had read another review and do not agree with the statement of the amount of fat in the ground meat. (there was less left than the 80/20 grass fed we tried) I believe if people contacted businesses with their issues instead of being so mean and impersonal by posting harsh statements, they would realize we are all human and mistakes happen. This company is doing their best to provide healthier food for more people at affordable prices. The fat from Wagu is actually good, healthy fat equivalent to Olive oil. I want to thank Joe for his understanding, kindness and generosity and Reserve Meats for making this high quality healthy meat available to the Azure community.

Noriko,US,7 days agoVerified,"Disappointing Service and Concerns Over Expiration DatesNormally, I am quite happy with the service I have received, even though some items may not show up from time to time. However, I was not at all satisfied with the last order because one box, containing 6 items, was missing. I sent an email and also made a phone call requesting a refund, but no call was returned. It took a week to receive an email asking if I had contacted the coordinator.Additionally, I had a question about an item expiring in a month, which left me in a bind as I couldn’t buy from somewhere else until I received an answer. The response I received was, ""Our policy is that anything with at least 2 weeks until the best by date will be sent out. This is not something that we would typically issue a credit for, and we cannot accept returns on food items.""That response made me reconsider ordering a 25lb bag, as freshness is very important to me. If that is your policy, I would need to see expiration information on the website so I can avoid purchasing products I won’t be able to use before the expiration date.Date of experience: December 16, 2024",2

WITCHHAVEN APOTHECARY,US,"Jan 5, 2025Verified","I have been a customer of Azure for…I have been a customer of Azure for many years. I volunteer as a drop coordinator along with my husband. We take pride in what we do for other customers of Azures. We have had multiple issues on our drops, not receiving items and items being in another person box etc. Upon phoning Azure and getting a ticket number for a call back. I have not been contacted about our drop issues. I waited days to only be told I missed the deadline. Which is 100% incorrect. As a business owner myself also my husband owns his own business as well. We are fully aware of how to successfully run our businesses. Now that’s been said, not returning calls is a big mistake. Also how to lose customers. Another thing that’s consistently getting worse, is that they will indicate they are out of a product, I will keep it in my cart anyway in hopes they will get it in before our truck leaves the warehouse. The point is that once it’s closed I will start a new order, and upon looking for the item I did not receive they have multiples of the item they did not send me. This is becoming a Azure Standard tradition. I spend a lot of time on the website am pro active to pay very close attention to sales, clearance, and new products along with what’s back in stock. I am on twice a day to check everything. I have also been highly disappointed that they have not cleaned up their website referring to all the discontinued products, they have been there for years and years now. It would be great if they could nix those products and clean it up so customers don’t waste time scrolling. I will continue to work with Azure as I do love there standards and products they use and do the work to make sure things are safe for customers. Overall our drop generates $8000.00 to $14,000 monthly. That’s great for our demographic. Thanks Date of experience: December 13, 2024",4

I have been ordering cracked corn for my chickens for over a year now...50% POWDER - so for chicken feed it is 1/2 useless.  I had a total of 2 bags out of 12 that were 100% usable with little powder.  I am now frustrated because I cannot leave a review for the product because there are no instructions on how to do it.  I see it is convenient to not allow people to make reviews on this product so that I cannot warn others.  So this is my second rating here that has gone lower to 1 because there was no response to me.I would now appreciate someone from Azure quality department to contact me and explain why this will not be the case in the future OR  change the product description to include the possibility that the product could be up to 50% powder.Date of experience: November 19, 2024",1

What I don’t understand is why you can’t change that. Isn’t there a way that you can take an item out of stock when someone orders it? Before I get an item I usually check to see if there are any in stock. In this case, it said you had over 4000 of them. I didn’t get my item so I went back and checked and it still said you had over 4000 in stock. I did call about it but to me there’s got to be a better way to do this.

Virginia Willems,US,"Jan 4, 2025Verified","Good outweighs the bad, but not by muchMany products arrive in good shape, fresh, and are good products.  With many orders, however, my produce is bad when I get it, and parts of it are unsalvageable.  I’ve had zucchini, onions, garlic, carrots, apples, and pears arrive partially spoiled.  I had debris (trash, in addition to many grains that are not wheat berries) in my last bag of wheat berries, and some of the non food products I’ve ordered have just been less than stellar.  I’m thinking of the dishwashing liquid soap, for example, and the Country Save laundry detergent.  I’ve had yogurt go bad very fast and sardines shipped to me that expired soon after arriving, and I would expect canned goods to have a far out expiration date when they arrive.  The most disappointing experience I have had by far was my November drop when the time was changed five times, including moved to a different day, and some of the times gave zero notice, so that I actually went to my drop three times expecting to get my groceries and found out then that the truck was not there. This was very frustrating, downright maddening.  On a positive note, many items I have ordered have shipped, have arrived in good shape, and have been very good foods and products.  The good has outweighed the bad so far for me (I’ve been a customer for about two years, I think), but not by much, and only because my schedule allows me to be flexible on pick up times.Date of experience: December 13, 2024",4

Doug & Rebecca Ueckert,US,"Jan 4, 2025","Poor customer service, unreliable shipments and arrivalsPoor customer service.  When orders arrive there are items missing or especially vegetables in poor shape, from the moldy case of red peppers to recently the asparagus that was rotting, to missing cases of squash in our last order.  We had trouble recently on a shipped order to get our expedited shipping that they shipped ground, the tracking showing it was shipped ground was not enough, they demanded the label on the box we had thrown away, so we had to find it and send the photo as well.  The person handling the complaint by email tried to tell us we would have to go after UPS and tried to blame UPS yet they were the shipper and shipped it ground, it took three emails to get them to reimburse us the expedited shipping we paid for at the place of the order.  The other complaint is you cannot depend on when the trucked orders will arrive, and they don't care about people who work and have schedules too, instead they send out emails saying to find a friend or someone else to pick up the order.  It used to be where when you checked out with your order you knew when the truck would arrive.  They have gotten too big and now they don't treat the customer as well and just expect everyone to just be available when they say it will arrive.   We work out of town, so that makes it difficult and especially with larger orders that require freezer space and refrigeration.   Date of experience: December 03, 2024",1

KD,US,"Jan 4, 2025Verified","First Order with AzureI recently picked up my first ever order with Azure and am very happy. The products are great, the selection is outstanding, my metro has a really good selection of drop points for pick-up, and the prices are pretty good, sometimes fantastic. The one thing I found frustrating was that I put items into my cart and checked out weeks before my shipment. Somehow, a few days prior to the truck leaving for my delivery, many of my items were out of stock. For the perishable items I do understand - Azure wants those to go to their customers before they go bad, so if they have the opportunity to provide those to someone else before my truck leaves they're going to take it. However, for packaged items it seems as if my items should have been ""checked out"" of inventory to me, so to speak, and put on hold for my order. While this was a frustration, I don't think it will keep me from using the service.I look forward to using Azure well into the future and am excited to see new products and developments as the company grows!Date of experience: December 14, 2024",4

Julia Macys,US,"Jan 4, 2025Verified","This was my first experience with a local drop.This was my first experience with a drop and it wentwell. I should have asked more about where the drop was as I did not expect a residential area and was alittle confused. The drop coordinator sent me a textto introduce herself and warn that a Wed drop wouldrun into trash pickup day. I like the whole concept and appreciate not having to pay a big delivery fee. The buckwheat groats are good quality. TX!Date of experience: December 13, 2024",5
