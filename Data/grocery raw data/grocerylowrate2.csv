Anthony Mark,US,"Jan 3, 2025","Poor Customer Service and Unprofessional Attitude ‚Äì Avoid This LocationWe‚Äôve been loyal 7-Eleven customers for over 20 years, but my experience at this location (7285 Crestway Dr, San Antonio, TX 78239) was beyond disappointing. Unfortunately, this wasn‚Äôt the first time my family or I encountered rude & unprofessional behavior from the staff here, but this incident was unacceptable! On Wednesday, January 2, 2025, I visited the store around 5 PM to pay for a car wash. When I inquired about the car wash, one clerk (Ricky) rudely stated it wasn‚Äôt working without any greeting or explanation, while another clerk (BZ - I guess) contradicted him and said it was functional. Both clerks didn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening in their location, displayed nasty and unfriendly facial expressions throughout the interaction, making it clear they were not welcoming or approachable to customers. Trusting BZ‚Äôs word, I paid and proceeded to use the car wash. Unfortunately, the car wash malfunctioned. The soap application did not work, and the system merely rinsed and dried my car without actually cleaning it. I returned to the store to inform the clerks, and Ricky admitted he had warned it wasn‚Äôt working. However, BZ dismissed my concerns, claiming my car parked outside looked clean because it was wet. Their rude attitudes and lack of basic customer service skills were extremely frustrating! After much back-and-forth and even waiting for BZ to test the car wash himself, he eventually admitted the soap function wasn‚Äôt working properly. However, instead of issuing a full refund as they promised at the beginning, they refunded only $5, insisting that since I had already used the car wash, I wasn‚Äôt getting more than that. Their unpleasant demeanor and refusal to resolve the issue professionally were infuriating. When I requested to speak with a manager, they laughed at me, ignored my concerns, and told me to come back the next day and that there‚Äôs no manager there. Their behavior was not only unprofessional but also disrespectful. Another customer in line even sympathized with me, acknowledging how poor their service was. In the end, my car remained dirty, I wasted my time and money, and I left feeling insulted. This location‚Äôs staff clearly lack the basic training and customer service skills needed for such roles. 7-Eleven management needs to take immediate action to train employees and ensure consistent service across all locations. I will not return to this store, and I plan to share this bad experience on Google Reviews, Yelp, and other online platforms to ensure others are aware of the unprofessional treatment customers might face here. Additionally, I will bring this up at our upcoming HOA meeting to inform all neighbors about this poor service to avoid this place.Until changes are made, I recommend avoiding this location entirely.Date of experience: January 02, 2025",1

So if someone wants to buy something or all that is on shelf 7-11 doesn't allow it and can limit quantities for purchase. 7-11 needs to get their crap together and why even be in business if you can't purchase what you want in quantities, guess 7-11 has turned into a woke company and doesn't want to make money and keep customers satisfied and happy.Date of experience: May 10, 2023",1

Waster Afs,US,"Jun 8, 2022","Cashier at 7-Eleven charges extra than what it's really worth...There is this 7-Eleven worker close to where my people's is located. This employee is known for scamming customer's. One example that I can give you is that he will charge me extra money for the items that I will buy. I know he does this on purpose because I went to this other 7-Eleven store not that far from that one. So I noticed that I got some change back from what I purchased. I asked the cashier how much he charges for cigarettes and he said $9 and some change. And at this store that I'm talking about he charges me $11 flat. That's because he adds $1 extra to the register. So I explained about me getting some change back from the other store when I would buy the same pack of cigarettes every time. He would respond with a grin on his face saying we'll go to the other store then. This is not fair for customers to be buying from this employee not knowing how much he charged extra.

M X,CA,"Feb 6, 2024","Sign In problemsI had the same problem with being unable to sign on (as I only have a land line and not able to receive a verification code by text) as with the person who sent a message on January 13th of this year. (Until recently I had no problem signing on.) I found a way to get a verification code by email; however, it does not work. After putting in my phone number and clicking, there was a request to resend the code. After clicking this, I was able to get the verification code by email. However, the code does not work. I called and talked to someone in customer support plus another in management and they could not explain anything except to state that a mobile phone was needed to get a text. So the situation suggests that 7-11 is out of touch and does not care about resolving the matter plus that there are major system problems as a verification code is sent by email but does not work. I do not think another phone number would work so using someone else's phone might not be a suitable choice. Why should I even have to borrow or buy a phone. I am at an impasse. Could someone check if they can get a verification code by email and find out if it works?Date of experience: February 06, 2024",1

Woodrow,US,"Jul 30, 2021","7-Eleven should be ashamedHere in the region of Texas where I live 7-Eleven bought a number of stores that were mostly local owned but a few from other larger companies as well, this started a couple of years ago.  The ones here locally I am more familiar with seem to experience a high turnover in employees.  Most are friendly enough but nearly all pretty much have the ""I'm not here long"" attitude but are still friendly.  The stores themselves are no longer kept up the way they were when locally owned.  Beverage coolers are now kept at the sort-of-cool setting.  Familiar items that once were there are gone to be replaced by 7-Eleven packaged items, which are at a level of not that good all to themselves.  The store closest to me has had the air conditioning out since late June and they have been relying on some portable units that struggle to keep the inside somewhat cooler than the outside and do nothing about the humidity, you would think corporate could at least have an air conditioner repaired in a south Texas store, especially in the summer.

Most of the employees are professional and courteous to custermers except except a mature lady, Sophia. She's very inconsiderate and has no awareness of custermer/business relations. This lady acts as if the customers need to bow down to her for service. For instance, I walked into the store to pay for to pay for gas and as a courtesy or some decency, I said good morning and Sophia act as if didn't existed. Another employee nervously worked over to ring up my gas and other merchant. To my disbelief, Sophia shuts dow the pump while while I was in the process of pumping over $25 of $35 of my gas. Ultimately, it took me an additional 15+ minutes for an overall 28 minutes for a refund or continue to get gas. Of course I opt to the refund as she cause me an unnecessary delay for work because she could have wait a minute long for me to pump the remaining $9.22 worth of gas. I asked for the manager as I would rather grab an item(s) equivalent to the refund that person didn't even come out to try and resolve the customer issue.

It's the worst one I've ever had to deal with. I've patronized 7-11in Canada and the USA for at least 40 years and until I moved to this 1 horse town, never experienced such horrible treatment (this doesn't apply to Jobie, Nicole or Andrea) The people are the worst example of customer service, they are rude, they are complete jerks when you want to accumulate points and quickly click off when offers come up to redeem. Why have a point system if you're going to give people a hard time about it. They can't seem to get a system for lining up to pay, people just walk in front of people waiting in line because you never know where to stand. If you've been waiting in line they don't tell the person that just went in front everyone to get to back of line. The manager Tracey is one of the rudest people I've ever dealt with, I have to wonder why these employees choose customer service employment if they are going to treat customers like crap. They don't really have to change because it's the only gig in town. I avoid 711 in MacKenzie as much as possible, but sometimes am forced to going there. If anyone else has bad experiences at this location, don't bother complaining to the manager because she don't care, call head office with your complaint. Like I said I've patronized 711's from Campbell river to Seattle and everywhere in between and I can assure you that MacKenzie 711 is the worst. The employees are nicer in the downtown Eastside in Vancouver. Do better MacKenzie 711, I'm sick of the mistreatment, especially as I spent a lot my hard earned money there as there's no other options, so I'm thinking they think they don't need to be nice to their customers.

Sharone Brown,US,"Sep 21, 2024","Dont shop while blackGood evening, I am desperately working to calm myself as I was embarrased and mistreated at the Mobil at 17100 S. Harlem Avenue in Tinley Park on 20 Sep 24 at 5 pm. My work vehicle had over heated upon pulling into the gas station for gas, I parked my vehicle, purchased a snack and then later on a separate receipt I purchased Coolant for $19.74 including taxes.  I sat for 30 minutes and returned with the Coolant to ask the cashier if I should purchase the Peak instead and upon looking at both I placed the peak back on the shelf and returned to my vehicle to use the coolant in hand that I had already purchased. The cashier a male of indian decent, smaller statue started aggressively banging on the window, then another male of the same ethnicity rushes out to tell me to pay for the Coolant; confused and embarrased as there were customers in the store and coming in with all eyes on me. I explained, I purchased this, the cashier begans yelling,  ""you did not, you can not steal and you are a thief."" I go to the car and grab my receipt and he refuses to look at the receipt, still calling me a thief as the store and activity literally stopped. In absolute desperation I attempt to see if a customer would look at the receipt, but of course no one wanted to intervene and I am clear on the why. I walk out as the cashier threatens to call the police and the manager and after the manager who assisted me thirty minutes prior, he no longer recalled the purchase. The cashier is still yelling as I walk out and is then followed by the other person working and even with the receipt with the date and time, I was still humilated, embarassed and accussed of stealing. I finally called the police and after the officer goes into the store, suddenly, the manger who was on another phone remembers me making the purchase. I am 52 years old, a professional, educated, home owner and all of your Mobil team saw was a black person who steals. I have never been so humilated  disrespected, all because of my skin.I have always patronized to Mobil/7 Eleven, but never again.Date of experience: September 20, 2024",1

I have never put a review online, good or bad, about anything but I am very tired of the way that I am treated when entering a store for gas or other types of items.  There is a store in Jacksonville, Fl that should have reduced patronage based on the customer service and distractions around the store.  I go to this store almost every day and there is always a homeless man, I assume he is homeless or he would be at home instead of sitting outside the 7-11 up against the wall all day long, sitting up against the wall right outside the door.  No one seems to have a problem with this.  Today I saw a woman sitting off to herself on the store property doing what appeared to be talking to herself.  Then I went in the store and bought lottery tickets and cigarettes.  The same cashier who had previously tried to keep a 10 dollar easy match lottery ticket winner from me threw my change across the counter at me.  I asked her why she through my change at me she said i through my money at her.  I placed the money on the counter after verifying the amount needed.  The safety of the customers are in jeopardy and the store should have some revenue reviews based on how they treat customers.  I called the customer service number which lead me to someone in El Salvador.  It was difficult to understand her.  Furthermore, I don't think it makes much sense to have a customer service contact phone number in another country when there are people out of work in the United States based on COVID-19.

I was using my credit card but a card reader#1 didn't work. I tried about few times, then it showed on screen ""pay later"". After I finished filling gas, it costed me totally $47.07. I was going to 7-11 store then, to pay this cost. Honestly, I didn't realized it was charged my credit card already, so I paid it again $47.0 with an store associate. When I reached at my house, I checked with my phone. Two of charge had showed up in my credit card notification. I was surprised Oh my god! I paid double by mistake. So, I went back to store immediately, it's around 6:30 am. I found another associate, his name is JAME. He is a store manager. At that time, I thought it's great! If a store manager is here, everything should be fixed. I asked him for refund though. Unfortunately, he had denied suddenly, not even been listening me clearly what was going on my case. He said he couldn't do because he was not a person who served me at the moment. Even I showed him a receipt though. This is ridiculous what from store manager I've ever heard before.I told him, YES YOU CAN!, NO MATTERS WHO WAS DOING. He opposed and said he was just alone in store, and couldn't do for me. Honestly, I can tell only him and I were in store at that time, nobody else! I told him the same words. He kept denying yet, against and not listening at all. He asked my phone number to call me back if he has checked everything. But he never do. I never meet the worst store manager like this before.

Being 30 years old I can confidently All right, listen up: I have lived down the street from this location for 30 years. Being 30 years old I can confidently recollect the last 15 or so. I recently learned that this store had changed hands from the private owner, John, to corporate management. On this here tonight, for the first time in history (as far as I‚Äôm concerned) I moseyed on over to the 711 only to find that it was‚Ä¶ closed? I thought that this was strange but without much question proceeded to drive a couple two tree streets over to the next 711, on the other side of Schiller Park. Rob Lowe and Behold, this 711 was also mysteriously and inexplicably closed. There was a sign that read ‚ÄúWe are sorry for the INCONVINCE.‚Äù Chronologically, I drove to the next closest 711, which was only another few couple blocks over, and was immediately relieved to learn that they were wide open for business. I asked the gentlemen working the register: ‚ÄúYou must be still be privately owned‚Äù to which I received an affirmative reply. this experience disappointed me for several reasons. First and foremost, I manage a corporation that purchases private businesses from family owners looking to sell with confidence that their legacy and brand will remain in good hands. As a purchasing entity, you do everything in your power to reassure a selling owner that the level of customer service they have spent decades establishing and maintaining will not be tarnished. It is incredibly disappointing to see this standard come into freefall in such short order following operational management being assumed by corporate. For roughly the last two decades, if the store was short-staffed, the owner was behind the register, had a broom in his hand, or was stocking shelves. The moment that corporate takes over, any level of ownership or personal responsibility ceases to exist. Whoever the operations manager is for this region should be relieved of their responsibilities, with haste. There is almost no legitimate reason for this to happen. Your payroll and bloated overhead costs are far too expensive to justify the inability to find solutions to operational challenges. For color, I live in the Midwest, and manage roughly 20 individual businesses ranging in location from CA to CO. On several occasions, when there has been no better alternative, I have flown out to these individual locations to fill in gaps and prevent any disruptions in operation.In summation: Do better.Date of experience: July 20, 2022",1

What should have been a convenient and seamless process turned into an ordeal that not only disrupted my family's day but also strained our finances and left us emotionally distressed.On 13/08/2023, I tried the Pay & Go feature for the first time while fueling up at the Bushland Beach service station. Unfortunately, the app's malfunction prevented me from finalising the transaction, forcing me to pay for the fuel in person. Later that day, I was left embarrassed and disheartened when my card was declined at the movies due to the unauthorized $100 holding fee, apparently authorized by 7-Eleven.What makes this situation even more disheartening is that not only did the app withhold $100 from my bank account, but I also paid for the fuel in-store due to the app's failure. This double payment compounded the financial hardship brought about by this incident.Despite my efforts to seek assistance at the Bushland Beach store and through the customer care phone line, the responses were inadequate and lacked empathy. This left my family unsupported over the weekend, adding to our distress.The emotional toll of this incident is immeasurable. Beyond the financial strain, the disappointment in my children's eyes and the heavy weight in my heart are reminders of this distressing event.As a loyal customer of the Bushland Beach store and someone who played a crucial role in advocating for its establishment within our community, this experience has been particularly disheartening. The incident contradicts my belief in 7-Eleven's commitment to excellence and customer care.I strongly urge 7-Eleven to address this issue promptly and effectively.

My husband and I patronize this franchise daily only because it is close to our home. From the owners to their staff every experience has been upsetting due to not only the extremely bad attitude of their cashier's but the owners, as well. When we shop we feel harassed by the owner who will follow us throughout the store for no reason, not one time did they offer any help in all times. We only stopped because it was for essential items not because the store gives a good shopping experience. As a bi-racial couple this type of behavior makes our experience uncomfortable and resistant to even patronize this store. Tonight Eric Crawford was not only helpful, smiling, and very sincere and it was such a relief to leave that store without anger and frustration because of implied prejudice and intolerance.

Dolly Dagger,US,"Oct 25, 2019","711 at 3827 S George Mason Drive SUCKS711 at 3827 S. George Mason Drive, Falls Church VA 22041. As the owner of a Service Animal, I always get into an argument with 7-Eleven employees. Corporate has assured me that all 7-Elevens welcome Service Animals, as posted on their front door. However, the employees are stupid and cannot read. Therefore, an argument normally ensues. I stand strong for my Service Animal. I wish 7-Eleven employees were smart people. Tonight, two male employees tried to make me leave the store. One of the employees said he was a manager. The argument we had was embarrassing. They are terrible people. I reported them to Corporate. 10.24.19 at 6:30pmDate of experience: October 25, 2019",1

Vera,US,"Sep 23, 2019","unprofessional and rude customer serviceStopped by 7-eleven Store# 13658 at address 375 West Madison Ave El Cajon, CA 92020, with my mom to get coffee and snacks. Went to the counter to get hot food said hi but neither associate paid attention to me. Lang was the girl at the register nd was busy reading some paper and the other associate was washing her hands and leaving, went to the register said hi again to Lang still no reply, said it louder and not even looking up at her paper she said ‚Äúwhat‚Äù  I said I want a chimichanga. She then kept reading her paper not even paying attention to what I said after about 2 minutes she went off to do something I thought she was getting my chimichanga, so when the manager walked up to the register to ask us if we‚Äôve been helped we said yes she was helping us but apparently she wasnt she was putting pizza in the display not getting our chimichanga and she walked up to the register and just looked at us and asked ‚Äúwhat do you want‚Äù in an already irritated mood I said ‚Äúlike I said a chimichanga‚Äù she snapped back and said ‚Äúdont get an attitude with me little girl‚Äù and I replied ‚Äúwell maybe if your customer was good I wouldnt but you had us standing here repeating ourselves multiple times not even greeting us when we first walked up because you‚Äôre too busy reading papers and for the second time telling you we want chimichangas‚Äù she started babbling that we didnt say anything the store manager had to say her name multiple times to calm her down. Store manager had left, and when she started ringing us up I asked where is your customer service Lang. She then cussed at me saying ‚Äúyou better calm your a**  down bitc* because my customer service is great mmhmm thats why i‚Äôve had this job for 12 yrs‚Äù I said oh really you‚Äôre an assistant store manager and you are going to cuss at me and talk to me like that.‚Äù And she replied ‚Äú mmhmm damn right imma cuss at you bitc*‚Äù I replied ‚ÄúDoesnt sound very ‚Äúmanager‚Äù like of you‚Äù in my head I was already furious and thought she‚Äôs no manager she must have slept her way to the top cause she doesnt have any customer service or respect. 12 years sounds to me she should find another job cause apparently this one isnt making her happy with her rude obnoxious remarks.Date of experience: September 23, 2019",1
