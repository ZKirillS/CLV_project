Caroline,US,2 days ago,"Poor communication, no accountabilityThere doesn't seem to be much respect for customers at this company. It took three weeks for them to ship my order, in disregard to the ""2-3 business days maximum"" turnaround time that they indicate on their website. My emails to check on the order status went unanswered for 10 days, nor did they answer the phone when I called. They finally responded to my 4th message with an excuse that my email went to spam.The shipment arrived with one item missing and a note saying it was backordered, though they hadn't mentioned that in the email and the order status page showed both items had been delivered. There was also no estimated timeline for the backordered item. Since I had no trust left, I canceled the remaining item.My purchase was meant to be a birthday gift, so I'm disappointed to have let down my friend.Date of experience: December 18, 2024",1

Erin,US,"Jun 20, 2023Verified","Too good...send helpI purchased the no-added-sugar cinnamon maca and cashew cardamom butters. I am *devouring* them, trying to preserve them for longer but there is no hope. They're just too delicious. They are perfectly flavorful, smooth, and subtly sweet from the almonds and spices, no need for coconut sugar (although the regular JEM is delicious too but more like a healthy frosting in my opinion). You will love this paired with fruit in all forms, or just eaten by itself.Date of experience: June 05, 2023",5

Peter Willis,US,"May 11, 2022Verified","Warning!!Warning! You will love this product. You will feel compelled to turn on all your loved ones to its deliciousness. If your partner has their own jar you will violate your integrity by sneaking spoonfuls from it. Get at least a jar for every one in your houses and put your names on it. Wrap the lid on tape with your signature written on it to see if the seal is ever broken. Makes gift giving easy, give it to everyone. You can even ship it directly to them, which is good because you won’t be tempted to keep it for yourself. Beware that it’s not unusual for a first timer to eat it in one sitting and then beg you to send more if they can’t find it locally. Handle with care!!!!Date of experience: May 11, 2022",5

The consistency tends to be cake batter-like so one can use these butters in a whole lot of different recipes from smoothies to ice creams and so on. They have few and all organic ingredients, and the jars/containers are good. Some are delicately sweetened, some a little more - could do with less, so that folks can add their own type and amount of sweetener to a preparation (say, maple instead of coconut) - so there is definitely room for improvement.

I purchased the cinnamon maca almond butter at my local grocery store because I really wanted my daughter to start eating nut butters.  She doesn't like the grainy nut butters that I enjoy so I saw that the JEM almond butter was ground to a silky consistency.  She LOVED it!  She now has something for sandwiches, crackers and raw veggies.  We ordered a larger jar of the cinnamon maca and a sample set from JEM's website and she now also loves the chocolate hazelnut and the cashew cardamom.  Not only are they delicious and healthy but they come in a glass jar (yay for not using plastic!) These JEM Organic nut butters are going to be a staple in our house.Date of experience: February 28, 2022",5
