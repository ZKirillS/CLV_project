Carole Rydeheard,GB,"Dec 27, 2024","Christmas Dinner Ruined We bought a Taste the Difference turkey crown for Christmas Day which was completely inedible and had to be thrown away. The suggested cooking time was over 2 hours but after 40 mins (in Lacanche oven which has perfect temperature control) it was at 74 degrees and incredibly dry despite butter, wine and lemon juice in the roasting tin. We tried the crown after resting and it was completely inedible; consistency of cardboard and no taste whatsoever.

Galina St George,GB,"Dec 2, 2024","Disappointing online shopping experienceI ordered some groceries online. I ordered milk as part of it, which, according to the driver, exploded and spilled all over the shopping. The meat tray (cardboard) got soaking wet and the steak turned grey. I ordered 4 packs of Warburtons potato cakes and they sent me 2 packs of a more expensive variety which I don't even like. I complained, and they issued a voucher instead of a refund. After the abysmal experience, I am not even going to use online shopping with Sainsbury anymore. A cherry on the cake: they issued a £4 voucher for the cakes when I complained and then replaaced it with a £2 one today - I guess as a difference between what I ordered and what they sent - and no apology for the messed up delivery!

Mr Rook,GB,"Nov 11, 2024","Not there yetStopped shopping is Sainsbury's before covid when I noticed price hikes of 10% on some basics one January. Tried Tescos and Morrisons for a while and noticed they're all up to the same tricks - price hikes, shrinkflation and the inhouse cheap stuff.Ive been an Aldi/Lidl shopper for some time now, but miss the Sainsbury's quality so i pop in from time to time - if Ive got a voucher from the petrol station.That's one good thing about Sainsbury's - cheapest fuel around.The quality is still there and if you're price aware you can find the good deals - like 1 litre Baileys for £10 if you've got Nectar.  But dont be fooled.  Baked beans now only 400g, instead of 410 or 415.  And most spreads are now 400g instead of 500?  I reckon middle management treat shoppers like we're stupid.  For example, 2 x 8 packs of Pepsi £6.50 with Nectar - that's over 40p per can! Is that supposed to be a good deal??  So they're still up to their old tricks, but little by little they're getting closer to the discounters.

However, I was disappointed by the number of tills open. There were only a few traditional checkouts available, and while there were self-checkouts for trolleys, they simply weren't sufficient for the volume of shoppers.In an effort to speed up the process, I ended up grabbing a basket to hold my trolley items, hoping to check out more quickly. This experience made it clear to me that Sainsbury's could improve their customer service by reducing the number of unused traditional tills and increasing the number of self-checkouts for trolleys.

Huge disappointment that on moving the Coca-Cola section a regular purchase preference has been discontinued. Coca-Cola ( classic ) in 250ml glass bottles, packs of four. The Worlds most popular drink after water in its best and original form. It tastes different and better in glass bottles…..it you know…it is the easiest blind test. It is not cheap…the best premium products never are and I understand that shelf space has to support profits and there are customers who prefer to buy 30o/2 litre cola products, on price or even Coke in cans or plastic bottles. I was in the canned vegetable section and shelf space is given to for example Artichoke Hearts, I fail to see the worthiness over my missing product that admittedly I may spend only £8 a week on.

Not sure what has gone wrong with Sainsburys but so far in the last 6 months, we’ve had a rotten chicken, mouldy nectarines, mouldy oranges, mouldy swedes and latterly mouldy tomatoes all well within life so no excuse. Seems like they aren’t storing the produce correctly. In addition the bakery is an absolute joke, almost an afterthought with a tiny counter - bread is tasteless, the Patisserie Valerie section is laughable and nothing at all would entice me to buy any bakery products. Why was the deli taken out? Apparently didn’t make any profit but now nothing fresh. If you want to know how to do things properly, take a look at Leclerc supermarkets in France (in particular Reims but applies throughout France).Meanwhile just keep making your massive profits but totally ignore customer service, food quality, choice of produce & store cleanliness.We’ll shop elsewhere now.Date of experience: September 21, 2023",1

First, you have to run the gauntlet of loud disco music when you shop there - appalling.Second, I am now filmed as I use the self checkout.  Third, whenever you want to see a manager, you get a 'duty manager', who is no more than any old employee whose turn it is to fill the spot.Fourth, while there is a good range of products, some of the food is definitely sub-standard.  Their tangerines, for example, are either fine or minuscule, impossible to peel without destroying them and taste bitter.  Their Ryvita flatbreads are almost always broken; you cannot see this until you open the package.Fifth, phoning Customer Service is a total waste of time.Sixth, writing a recorded delivery letter to the CEO does not even elicit the courtesy of an acknowledgement, let alone a reply.By contrast, Marks and Spencer across the road is infinitely better but much smaller, without the wide variety of stock.  There's also a Morrison's a short drive away that is also far better, and as I frequently pass this I shall try buying there in the future, if only to avoid the awful disco music.It would be foolish to imagine that any major supermarket cares tuppence about any complaints like these as long as the money keeps rolling in, but at least I have a choice in this area.Date of experience: July 22, 2024",1

One of the brain surgeons working here has placed a large soft drinks display up against this board, right in the centre, completely obscuring most of the adverts. Kind of defeats the object, yes? What makes this even more idiotic, is that they should simply have placed the display about 18 inches to the left against a bare patch of wall - leaving the board clear for the public to read - whilst still maintaining a prominent position visible to customers in the queue, or walking to the till point.

I used my phone to pay as I usually do but it wouldn't work tried a few times on both tills using different cards in my google wallet and nothing, I explained to the cashier called Angela I had no other means of payment and would need to go home and get my actual card as there was nothing else I could do. I was happy to leave my details and phone with them as I it wouldn't take more than 10 mins. At which point her response ""if you take your car i will call the police "" to which I said i totally understand but is there another way you can help me as I don't know what else to do as you have seen and she said ""well noone else has had an issue with paying"" so i said I'm willing to show you my bank account to prove I have the funds to which she said "" I don't like your attitude"" baring in mind I'm asking for help not being abusive just trying to come to a resolution. I then said to her I don't know what else to do and Angela then says ""that's your problem not mine"" I then asked for a manager to be told she didn't have a manager and I could go to the store.  Her colleague then helped me by taking my details on the back of receipt paper and I went off home to get my bank cards, I came back to pay but couldn't pay using contact less but could by using chip and pin. I noticed at this point other people were having similar issues. I then went to the store and spoke to a manger who told me they have a process for this kind of thing and all she had to do was ask me to fill in a non payment form at no point was this offered to me. I was spoken to like dirt, treated as if I was trying to get out of paying. Angela's attitude was disgusting. What's interesting is that there is a sign up referring to treating the staff kindly not being abusive yet the staff can be a abusive as they like!

The last time I was there I bought, what I thought were nectar deals and was surprised that the check out prices were so high. But I thought maybe I'd made a mistake. Yesterday I made proper notes of items. I discovered at the Check out that whilst prices said 'reduced' on shelf if bought with a nectar card, it wasn't true at all. Even when I questioned it, the shop staff actually said I needed to remove a sticker that said reduced and look below! I now believe the whole nectar thing is a total rip off (at least in Camden) where the supermarket is making up prices. I won't be shopping there again. Also can't even email Sainsbury's these days.

My nose is still burning.* All three of the urinals are out of service, two have been covered for over a week, the third is brimming with stale urine. * Of two toilet cubicles, only one is in use. (Again, this is over a week out of service) The useable cubicle has toilet rolls just dumped, unhygienically on the floor and on a pipe!* The washing basin facility is useable but is extremely broken down.I have pictures to back up this review.This is NOT the standard I would expect from a major store and would suggest that this could be a very powerful deterrent to people visiting the store since, if Sainsbury's are happy to display this level of care to their customers, how much care goes on behind the scenes with the storage and handling of the food and other items?Date of experience: October 29, 2023",1

I know that a lot of shops get an extreme bashing from many customers (Rightly so most of the time) as the staff is too busy to help you throw products into place (Know wonder stuff is bruised) or talking amongst themselves about how tired they are. That said. After locating the Bagels I made my way to the Easter Egg aisle I'd noticed on the way in. Anyway, as I was trying to make a choice I spoke to a member of staff (Gersina Dacosta) rearranging the eggs who by the way had a warm pleasant smile as we spoke. Also, seeing that I was having some difficulty making a choice she asked old the child was. Next, she directed me to an area whereby there were more Easter eggs for the ages of the children I was buying for. Despite the enormous task of rearranging just about the entire two eggs sections, Gersina had the warmest of smiles that would have defused even the most irate customer having a meltdown. I shared the information she'd offered me with other customers that acknowledged just how disappointed they might well have been had they not come across that section of eggs.

Not very clear which products were included, but only one side and dip option available so I took those and asked a group of three staff who were together on the next aisle.  Senior staff member present confirmed I had selected the correct items for the £5 meal deal, so I went to the checkout.Items came to £10.23!  Assistant on the checkout knew that was incorrect so asked the senior colleague for help.  The senior colleague went off to look at the shelf and never came back!  Another staff member tried to adjust the total but was unable to do so.  I was there so long that a long queue formed and a member of the public offered to pay the difference for me, it was so humiliating!In the end I said leave it and went back to the shelf to have a look myself.  The senior staff member was still there and again acknowledged that the items I had selected were labelled as a £5 meal deal but said that was incorrect.I left without buying anything in the end.The numerous staff present could have manually adjusted the total, or they could have offered an alternate product for the £5 meal deal.  They did neither, they just acknowledged the error and scratched their heads while I stood waiting like an idiot!I'll go elsewhere in future.Date of experience: March 31, 2023",1

Lucy,GB,"Updated Mar 12, 2022","Sainsbury Delivery Disturbance.I would give no stars if I could. Perhaps Trustpilot would like to consider that.  I am being woken on a regular basis by the grocery delivery vans any time between 6.30am and 7.30am on a weekend. These are not deliveries to people who are disabled but to a big young man who lives a few doors away. It is a cul de sac and I live on the corner so even moving my bedroom to the back would not help. First I have the caw caw as the van turns round then banging doors, banging crates and crates being wheeled to the delivery location and then everything in reverse. I have also heard loud conversations where the driver is having a nice chat with the customer. This is with my double glazed windows closed, so it will be even worse when I need to have windows open. These deliveries are used by customers to save themselves about £1 at the expense of their neighbours' sleep. Covid restrictions are over and there is no need for the early deliveries. I have lived for over 6 decades without the need for them and I have worked shifts! Calls to Sainsbury to complain make no difference and when asked to be quieter the drivers couldn't care less. Unacceptable. Ruining my sleep and woken with palpitations due to the sudden noises. Thanks Sainsbury.

Shaun Champion,GB,"May 21, 2023","Train your staff on disability awarenessWandsworth Road store.  20.05.23 23:00I have been a loyal customer of Sainsbury's for nearly 30 years.  I have always enjoyed shopping at the various stores and interacting with the friendly staff.Unfortunately, in my experience, this has changed.  Two times in the last three months I have left the store after I disagree with a procedure or something else with a member of staff and then 2 or 3 others join in, gossiping amongst themselves and even shouting over at me from other tills.  On the last occasion one of the managers was so rude that when I told him I was going to complain he refused to give me his name and walked off.After my last experience I waited to speak to one of the senior store managers and explained that I have a disability, albeit one that isn't visible.  That being shouted at and confronted by more than 1 member of staff is intimidating and triggering and likely to result in a hostile reaction.  He apologised and said to phone in with my complaint.  I did so and was told that staff should be more aware and certainly shouldn't be grouping together against you.  That staff, one in particular, would receive training.  I'm not sure if that has happened, but that same member of staff came over to join in again.  My disability means that I struggle with going out at the best of times.  Experiences such as this shouldn't happen.  I'm hoping that someone from the store contacts me so I can avoid this happening to me again.Date of experience: May 20, 2023",2

No signal, the joke is they even have the self scan thingies so you scan everything as you go round but because there's no signal in the store it cant connect to your app and it takes for ever. But mostly, this shop is so badly stocked. Always runs out of milk and bread, items which show on the nectar app as on offer very often are not in the kelso store. WHY!?. Offers are always understocked anyway, because its in a tourist area it stocks too many tacky nonsense camping food items and forgets that this is one of only 2 supermarkets servicing the entire area within a 20 mile radius if not more! Stop prioritising seasonal tourists and think about the people who need to use it all year round! All the locals would prefer an ALDI or TESCO in its place trust me, but we are stuck with it. The closure of the cafe was bad enough, it sells clothing but doesn't offer a changing room!! No chicken stock, no pickled onion crisps, a zillion cheese and onion, bakery never has enough rolls or baguettes, doesn't sell beer from LOCAL breweries, a zillion ales, not enough craft beer..no they are not the same.

As a loyal customer who frequently shops at their supermarket, I cannot support a company that seeks to silence different viewpoints and opinions. GB News provides a much-needed alternative perspective in the mainstream media landscape, and it is concerning to see a major retailer like Sainsburys cave in to pressure and attempt to silence a legitimate news outlet. Boycotting GB News not only goes against the principles of free speech and diversity of thought, but it also alienates a significant portion of their customer base who value the content and reporting provided by GB News.

David G.,GB,"Dec 4, 2023","How come every time I come here, there is a problem with the self-service till? I don't know, I didn't make the tills.Sainsbury branch on Lewes RoadSainsbury branch on Lewes Road, Brighton. As is so often the case at this branch, insufficient staff on duty. At 3.30pm only one staff member helping with the 20 or so self-service tills and a queue to reach these. There were manned tills open, three rather than the usual one or two, but these were busy with folks with big trolley loads and queues of their own.As I approached the self-service tills, I despondently left behind a bottle of alcohol, as buying alcohol requires two attendances by the staff - one to approve the bottle and confirm customer is over 18, the second to remove any security tagging. In doing this, I hoped to save time in the self-service area, knowing how busy the single staff member can get.Yet, lo and behold, half-way through scanning my items, the machine played up, the red light came on and the sign ""Remove item from basket"" shone out accusingly. I adjusted the position of the basket/products and removed the last item scanned but this made no difference. I had a frozen item I wanted to get home asap, too. But had to wait nearly 10 minutes till the staff member came to my end of the check-out area. (By now, the till next to me also had a red light.)There was no fault in my usage, just the usual joy of the machine playing up. When, I said, ""How come every time I come here, there is a problem with the self-service till?"", the reply I got was a cursory and sarcastic, ""I don't know, I don't make them."" This smart-ass rudeness and lack of care passes as wit and an appropriate response among the 20 year-old members of staff at this sad branch of the supermarket. In a previous experience, I wanted the staff to approve some alcohol. Oh, we can only approve it at the end of your shop. ""Why?"", said I, ""If Tesco can approve it mid-way through the shop, why can't you?"". Clearly, I was trying to save time as the staff was nearby. ""Oh, it's not our problem if Tesco does it differently"", was the unhelpful response.I draw the following conclusions:1. There needs to be more staff on duty at the self-checkout areas.2. Staff need training in appropriate and sympathetic responses to customers' problems with the technology. 3. The machines need renewing. A long-standing member there has told me the machines are by now very old and every single one of them has a fault(s).Some of the products at Sainsbury state ""Aldi Price Match"".

ChK,GB,"Oct 31, 2022","Appalling customer servicePoor customer service and zero regard for customer interest. Staff doesn’t think twice about inconveniencing customers, as long as it serves the staff. One Sunday I spent ages helping an elderly lady with her trolley full of shopping because exits from the shop to the carpark were closed ached off the store closure time. The lady had to get out on the street and walk from one outside lift to another (all broken) to get to the carpark. At the same time a group of staff were chatting and laughing near the door, killing time until 4pm. I later found out that it was a standard practice to lock doors to the carpark ached of time. Shopping trolleys are faulty and often the wheels get blocked at the lifts. I’ve seen it happened a few times and it has just happened to me. I was not allowed to pick up my bags and go, despite explaining that I had a medical appointment in a few minutes. I was threatened by a staff member, younger than my child, that she would call security guards if I didn’t wait with the trolley. I wanted to leave the shopping so I wouldn’t miss my appointment but this was not allowed either. I had to wait a while before the wheels were unblocked and I was allowed to go. I arrived late for my appointment. There had been numerous issues, mainly with a very poor customer service. On one occasion I purchased a mouldy pitta bread (still within expiry date), on another occasion 4 packs of Sainsbury’s organic spoiled tofu (also within expiry date). I informed the customer service, provided photos, only to be interrogated like a criminal. I gave up and just binned the tofu. The pitta bread was eventually replaced, but not before naïve questioning, which was really humiliating. On another occasion there were no trolleys available at all. I informed one of the aimlessly wandering staff about it and decided not to wait for the trolley. I finished my shopping, paid and there were still no trolleys, and another person was asking for them. This is the first time I looked at Trustpilot reviews and was shocked that 70% are negative comments. I could not find any responses from Sainsbury’s, which only confirms that they do not care about customers at all. I used to do almost all my food shopping at Sainsbury's for many years, but in recent years not so much, even it is the closest food store. I think I will be avoiding them all together from now on.Date of experience: October 31, 2022",1
Alexander,GB,"Jan 30, 2024","""Sainsbury'sSainsbury's: High Prices, Questionable Dry Goods Quality""Sainsbury's: High Prices, Questionable Dry Goods Quality""As a frequent shopper, I've come to know Sainsbury's quite well, and if I had to rate my overall experience, it would reluctantly hover around a 7 out of 10. Unfortunately, this score is more due to a lack of negative incidents rather than the presence of positive ones, as the service rarely ventures beyond mediocrity.The food selection, while marginally better than what you might find at the average supermarket, fails to impress. It's a stretch to consider it excellent or to classify any item as truly top-tier. While there are occasional bursts of quality, they are the exception rather than the rule, leaving much to be desired for those with a discerning palate.A particularly sore point is the quality of Sainsbury's dry goods. Even when these items are well within their use-by dates, their quality can be hit-or-miss. This inconsistency is a point of contention, especially when compared to other supermarkets, which seem to uphold a higher standard of quality control for their non-perishable products.The pricing strategy at Sainsbury's is, bluntly put, disproportionate to the quality of goods on offer. The premium pricing would be justifiable if the products were exceptional, but as it stands, the value proposition is lacking. Other supermarkets have demonstrated that it is possible to offer better or comparable quality items at more reasonable prices, which puts Sainsbury's at a disadvantage in the market.In summary, Sainsbury's seems to be content with being slightly above average, but for customers paying premium prices, this complacency is a disservice. The store needs a rigorous review of both its pricing strategy and quality control, particularly for its dry goods. Only then can it hope to justify its prices and elevate its service beyond the current plateau of mediocrity.---Date of experience: January 30, 2024",3

paul tapner,GB,"May 18, 2023","The apathy of early morningI will give Sainsbury this. They are convenient. I visit the main one in Poole regularly because it's on my way to work and that allows me to get in there at 7am when it opens. Avoiding crowds later in the day. Trouble is you seem to be an inconvenience if you do that. Staff are all shelf filling, so you feel like you're getting in the way. Only rarely do they say good morning. Because they're all shelf filling there's never a manned till. So you have to use self service. And the machines when they've just come on will often just freeze and not do anything. Tell the staff this and they say in an apathetic tone 'oh they're really slow first thing in the morning.' Well thanks for caring. If I encountered a problem where I work I would tell the customer what I was going to do to get it fixed. And I would make it so. In fact the other week I heard two staff talking about how people come in to look at the machines and fix them. Go away. And nothing gets done.On this particular occasion I was using a self service till, because of course there was no manned one and no staff in sight. When I put my bank card in to pay absolutely nothing would happen. It said someone is coming to help you. Nobody did. I saw one member of staff walk past nearby clearly totally oblivious. After four tries with my card getting the same message to no avail for four mins I moved to the next till and did it there and it worked fine. I have filled in umpteen customer feedback forms about this issue. I have written to their complaints department twice. But nothing ever changes.So they're ok to shop with, if you don't do it first thing. But don't waste your time on customer service feedback. Because it's clearly ignored.

Daren  Hart,GB,"Jun 22, 2023","Representatives of Sainsbury's WhitechapelBefore I eventually Got to Speak with the Duty Manager, I was lied to by the Member of Staff on Duty in Customer Services two-fold, Firstly I was told the Person I wanted to bring the matter to the Duty manager about by being told as if The Customer Services Staff’s Opinion about the Matter was of any Importance for me to Be Dealing with the Duty Manager including The Staff’s Blatantly Lying that such a Person Worked in that Branch and then after another Staff Member of that Store had Made it Perfectly Clear there was always a Duty Manager Present in Store at all Times, he Lied by telling Me No Duty Manager was in the Store. Then I was asked by the Supervisor of Self Service Tills why I wanted to See the Manager (it had nothing to do with him, and was None of His Business), I had Asked Jim Exceedingly Politely for his Assistance in Knowing Where I Could Find the Duty Manager, especially so as the person who was at Customer Services Desk had just Blatantly Lied to Me!I Decided to walk Away from the Ignorant Staff, to Avoid becoming any more Irate due to Being Treated so Badly! I found a Very helpful Chap who was pushing a Cafe of Supplies to Refill Shelves in Store, if He Knew where the Duty Manager was, he Looked about a pointed me to an Isle with a Very Tall Strong Burley Looking Man was attending some Shelves, I approached and Asked if he wa the Duty Manager (later I asked for His Name and was told it was Raj).I Explained from the Beginning once again, as to how a Supervisor Named “Shira” had been both Rude in her manner and Actions on the Behalf of Sainsbury’s Superstores, a young Lass at 1413 that day had Asked her if they would Report that White Seedless Grapes I had bought the Previous Night Reduced by 46p to £1.84 from £2.30 with a Best Before Date of 25th of June were Actually Rotting , that I Could not see this when I purchased them, and only Found Out When I opened the Pack and had started to eat them, during this 2 absolutely disgusting Greyish Grapes Fell out from the midst of the Bunch into the Plastic Tray/Pack I Bought them in! Shira had look with barely a fleeting glance and responding to the Young Lass with only a Sideways Nodding of her Head, in the Negative, I seeing this Asked of Shira if she was Sure as I didn’t Believe Sainsbury’s would want their Reputation to be of Selling Seedless White Grapes in date that were Actually Rotting, Shira simply Nodded Vertically without a Word Indicating She was Sure that nothing would be Done Nor Did She Care, I said Fine I will be making a Formal Complaint as I far From agreed with her Conduct or Perspective as a to Sainsbury’s Good Name ( I have Shopped at 1 Cambridge Heath Road, Since mid-80s and Never Seen the Staff Represent Sainsbury’s Superstores this way!I went on to Explain to Raj (Duty Manager the Night of 21st June 2023) as to how the Customer Services Desk Staff had Acted, with Great Detail! Then I went on To Explain how the Self Service Tills Supervisor had Responded to my Request for the Duty Manager’s Whereabouts, Raj at this point Confirmed my Perspective of Sainsbury’s Superstores, as they had never Before in his Experience Deliberately Sold Rotting Food of Any Description, and that he wasn’t just saying this Because of himself be the Duty Manager, but as Someone Akin to Myself who had Always Shopped at Sainsbury’s Superstores and Never Known the Likes of this to have Occurred, I have Never had this happen in all the Years i.have been Shopping at any of Sainsbury’s Stores, so Could Fully Appreciate his Comments!Raj (Duty Manager) said he would deal with this Matter and be bringing it to the Attention of the Day Manager, which I thought meant he was taking it Seriously, however as a Female Store Staff Member was walking up the Isle Contrary to his Response to my Mention Shira’s Name made out to her as though he had Never Heard of Shira Before as he asked do you know anyone called Shira (exactly the way the Customer Services Desk Staff had done) I pointed out to Raj (Night Duty Manager) that he had only moments ago Acknowledged Knowing of Shira and Asked why he was now Pretending not to Have Even Heard of Her, he made out that I had Misunderstood Him!When he said he was going to deal with this Matter making Sure the Day Duty Manager Knew about all that had Occurred, he Said some Rather Foolish things as to how he would find out who had been on Duty at the Customer Services Desk, and also who was on Duty at the Self Service Tills as Supervisor!

How disappointing that all the fresh produce had a max of 2 days to expiry date meaning I’ve had to throw most away and have no means of replacing. I am now reliant on family shopping for us instead when I ordered plenty for the week. I tried to complain to customer services to be told in no uncertain terms that policy is fresh produce is acceptable as long as it is sent with 2 days left until the best before date?! My complaint cannot be escalated and my only other option is to write and post a physical letter to head office. Hardly ideal when I’m isolating. The poorest service I’ve had in a long time, it’s the only time I have been reliant on someone else to shop for me, and Sainsbury’s really let us down.

Why didn’t I read these reviews prior to placing an order? I could cope with the shorter life dates on some items but after opting for NO substitutes, I was frustrated to find that my choice of English lamb steaks hadn’t been delivered and I received New Zealand instead. I phoned customer services immediately to state that I had opted out of the substitute items only to be told that ‘You don’t get a choice of where the meat is sourced! I asked him to explain why if that’s the case, you specifically show a picture of English lamb- Union Jack on the packaging to boot! After referring to his supervisor, he told me that I should read the small print under the item. By the way, I’ve done this since and at no point does it state you cannot choose between English or New Zealand lamb. He then informed that they wouldn’t be able to refund for this reason. To be honest, I wasn’t quibbling the £4 odd cost. It was more the frustration and inconvenience caused. He then asked me why I didn’t want New Zealand lamb!! I thought this was irrelevant and none of his business or telling him about carbon footprints but decided to be completely honest and tell him that my family can ‘Taste the Difference’ ironic eh! We find English lamb leaner, sweeter and a totally different flavour.I honestly think this falls under the Trades Description Act!Needless to say that I sent an email complaint on Monday and still haven’t received a response!

Kirsty Mackenzie,GB,"Feb 11, 2021","I booked an online food order on Monday…I booked an online food order on Monday 8th Feb. It never showed up, no contact from Sainsbury, until an email telling me my refund had been processed. My food order money was back in my account so I called customer service out of confusion and got told bad weather had prevented deliver, which I accepted because of heavy snow. I went back onto my banking app to find they had taken my order money back.  Luckily I had the foresight to have an order booked for last night and redid my food order. My groceries were due between 21.40 and 22.40 last night. 23.15 and no delivery and no contact from Sainsbury's. Called customer service and was told the driver was running 60 to 90 minutes behind and could I wait up please? I stated that I had watched 3 Tesco vans and an Asda van deliver groceries to my neighbours today, so wont be accepting bad weather as the excuse this time. 01.00 this morning and no delivery, no contact either. Called customer service this morning to be told they had no idea why I my groceries weren't delivered and ""whatever, click and collect next time"". Since Monday I have called Sainsbury 6 times. The first agent was apologetic and helpful. The last one was too. But the 4 invetween treated me disgustingly. I explained I was suffered a brain aneurysm which left me with permanent cognitive problems and I can no longer drive. I explained I am very isolated where I live and don't have the £50 round trip taxi fare to click and collect. I explained I am facing a severe food crisis with 2 young children in the house. I explained I also can't work and have very little income and can't rectify their mistake unless they refund my grocery order and not keep holding on to it. Their replies to these statements were ""I'm not listening anymore, have a good day"". ""Go annoy someone else"" and ""go to a food bank"" then having the phone put down on me. I changed to using Sainsbury because I got tired of Asda only delivering half of what I ordered every week. Now I can see that I made the biggest mistake ever, trusting a supposed major supermarket with my essential needs. Never again. And I will make sure I broadcast their treatment of me everywhere.Date of experience: February 11, 2021",1

Fergi,GB,"Updated Feb 9, 2021","DeliveryRegular monthly on line shopping. We are 80 years old and Sheilding since March 35 miles from Dundee Sainsbury’s. Booked slot on 25th Jan for delivery on 8 Feb. On morning of 8th email said three items substituted and we’ll see you soon between 12-1pm. 4pm came so tried calling (took 1 hour and gave up) called Dundee and a home worker said my card didn’t go through ( not true) then changed to say they were trying to contact a backlog ( 431 customers) . They have two numbers and email address for me. Surely from 25 Jan I was high up list. I contacted Head Office three times - automated reply surprise surprise! We live in an isolated Glen and track to our house blocked with snow but told Sainsbury’s main road clear but I’ve arranged to get someone to meet delivery van on main road wherever it suited them . Everyone was on standby.  Snow again today  and as yet no word from Head Office. I’ve shopped with Sainsbury’s for years and started on line 2 years ago due to poor health. I know us oldies are are clogging the world up and accept but we have to eat. My daughter tweeted them & their reply was I’d get a refund( none needed) . We can’t eat a refund and now they’ve landed us in the proverbial as registered as Government high risk category with Sainsbury’s. We have a stock of food always but have to top up larder regularly as it does dwindle. If we lived in town we could click and collect for someone to pick up but impossible in a country area. I reordered again for Sunday as advised by Dundee  . When asking what’s the point phone went dead! but if there’s such a back log not holding out much hope.

Sheila McGrory,GB,"Jan 19, 2021","Dreadful service at all levelsI have had mixed fortunes with Sainsbury's - there have been some fantastic staff & experiences and some not so much. Last week I placed my weekly online order & duly waited on its arrival with my own bags sitting at the door to decant into from the crates (There's a whole other issue there but I digress). My slot was between 2 and 3 o'clock. I received an email at 2.50 to advise my order had been cancelled ""due to adverse weather"". The weather that day was not great but my gripe was in receiving this notification so late in the day. I got the usual email advising of what products would be missing from my delivery early on in the day when the weather was much worse so it makes no sense to me that a judgement call was not made much earlier in the day also. 🤷🏼‍♀️ In addition, they send a text message every week the day before my delivery, and if this had been done about the cancellation too,I would have picked up the message much quicker. It was well after three before I checked my emails to see if there was anything amiss. I had made a special trip in the morning to obtain the items I was advised would be missing. I could have just done the whole shop then but I was not aware of their decision. The email also gave a number to contact Customer Services - which I did  (the customary ridiculously long telephone queueing system ensued) thinking that they would be able to re-arrange for me but the short version was no. They don't keep emergency slots for people who have been let down - never mind have the technology to transfer your order details over.The only thing the adviser could do was log my concern and pass it on and even she had to agree that this was shoddy service! Almost a week later I am still waiting on a response from that avenue.In addition, I sent an email to the CEO, Mr Simon Roberts, who hasn't bothered responding even via one of his ""minions"" although he did send me an email (and everybody else probably) on the 12th urging me to help ""keep everybody safe"" when visiting stores.Point being, I had to make yet another trip the next day to get the remainder of my items; so more risk under the current conditions, etc. which would have been unnecessary if my delivery had been made .This just says to me that poor service is endemic from the top down so if you expect good service, seamless delivery when due plus proper communication - don't use Sainsbury's............Date of experience: January 19, 2021",1

John Warren,GB,"Dec 29, 2020","Rotten Christmas Turkey CrownThank you Sainsbury's for ruining our Christmas dinner by selling us a rancid foul-smelling turkey crown which was bought on 21st December from one of your stores in North Yorkshire. It had a ""use by"" date of 26 December and was kept carefully refrigerated as per the instructions until  Christmas morning when it was taken out ready to be cooked.  Upon removing the plastic wrapping the smell from the turkey was disgusting and it was covered in a yellow slime.  There was absolutely no way was this going to be cooked and eaten - it went straight in the bin.  Result - a disappointed family and a Christmas dinner devoid of its main component.  As if 2020 hadn't been bad enough.And this from Sainsbury's, the ""holier than thou"" retailer that never stopped telling us in its adverts  leading up to Christmas what a caring socially-responsible organisation it was and all the enormous lengths it was going to ensure that we would be safe from Covid if we visited its stores.  Not only that but all its ridiculous posturing over socio-political causes such as Black Lives Matter and its controversial TV adverts .Here's a thought, Mr Mike Coupe, CEO,  and your Executive Team.  Why not concentrate on selling good quality food that won't put your customers in hospital with food poisoning instead of trying to appease the liberal elite with your ludicrous politicised advertising campaigns and your ""right-on"" messages and emails.  That way you might actually gain a bit of respect from the public and avoid visits from Trading Standards to investigate your food hygiene practices.Date of experience: December 29, 2020",1

Over the last couple of months my local Sainsbury's has become absolutely diabolical when it comes to home delivery. Delivery drivers are rude and inconsiderate, despite knowing the customer is disabled/vulnerable and needs assistance with the delivery. The order pickers send products that are damaged beyond use and/or have shelf life of less than 24 hours, and also send absolutely RIDICULOUS substitutes. When you call to complain you're met with rude and aggressive staff who make you out to be a liar and talk to you as if you're stupid, then do all they can to avoid refunding you for the money you've wasted trusting them with a weekly food shop. I have a disabled/vulnerable account with them too, so they should know that the food they send is essential and is required to last at least a week since we can't get out to the store to buy replacements nor afford a follow up delivery. The fact they treat their customers in most need so terribly speaks volumes. I've lodged complaints with them about the service, and every time I'm told someone will be in touch, but no manager ever contacts me. It's clear they simply do not care any more, obviously because they don't need to have respect/concern for individual shoppers since they're making money hand over fist from the pandemic. Disgraceful company and looking at the reviews here it's not just a local problem. Wouldn't hurt for their practices to be exposed in the national press, if you ask me.

Finally she said she would send it again (as they failed to send it last week),I asked her specifically NOT to send PDF but she ignored my request and did. She clearly is working in the wrong department and suddenly got agitated when I called her out for doing the opposite to that which I requested she slammed the phone down on me. I then tried to register the card on line but true to their technology problems there is no actual security question which it requires to register. The drop down menu offers nothing. If you attempt to move on it says ...please fill in the security question. I spent around 30 min on this their technology glitch  but sadly it is so bad it is a waste of time.

Your feedback has taught me to keep going in store for produce, that way is the best service guaranteed!Also, Sainsbury's have had a relaxed face mask attitude, which has made me respect them more, they have been the 'calm' when other stores have been absolute Lieutenant Marshalls, you get through to people better depending on the manner in which you speak to them, and they have handled this Pandemic brilliantly.I like the warm, cheerful laughter that ricochetes around the Selly oak, Birmingham store as soon as you enter, 'illuminating' from the staff that work there.

Rob Hindle,GB,"Updated Aug 15, 2020","Can't find a way to complain that worksOn Wednesday we picked up a click and collect order  from Archer Rd Sheffield store. Having been disappointed with previously purchased oranges we opted to pay the premium for ""Taste the difference"" fruit. Got home to find one completely rotten and growing fur.  Tried to email them, can't find a complaints dept. email address. Their website directed me to use FB Messenger, tried that last night and again this morning.  No response.  That may be my fault, first time I've tried to use messenger so,  Sainsbury's, it's a poor channel of communication to rely on if there's a learning curve for customers and particularly so for the elderly who may not use social media. (The same applies to Twitter which they also suggest using). I know they'd like customers to phone but I can't send a photo that way. I don't want to spend 15 minutes listening to canned music (I charge my customers £60/hour so that wait alone represents a ""lost opportunity"" cost of £15) and be told every minute the ""your call is important to us"" (but not sufficiently important to answer the phone...). Contact means shouldn't be THEIR choice but that of the customer.  (And I try to avoid anything that involves Facebook.)  The reason for one star the inability to contact them through messenger or email.UPDATEI observe that most large organisations (and very many smaller ones) monitor TrustPilot reviews and make a serious effort to rectify issues raised.  Looking through the two TrustPilot accounts for Sainsbury's (supermarket) it seems they are happy to disregard all those unhappy customers.I mentioned ""lost opportunity cost"" earlier, well on that basis Sainsbury's now owe me several hundred pounds.My conclusion: Sainsbury's have realised that if you make it hard enough to complain customers will give up, write it off to experience and will forget about their bad experience in a few weeks time. As for those that don't?  Perhaps Sainsbury's view that as a win-win situation for them. No need to waste the time, effort and cost to address the issue.  Maybe Sainsbury's will lose a ""problem customer"" who can go and be a nuisance to a competitor and waste *their* time, effort and money.I take the other view: that an unhappy customer will typically tell ten friends and family and multiply the damage.  That's certainly what I'll be doing and I suggest you do the same.While I'm here, another small gripe. If you order an item that's on offer and the delivery slot is after that offer expires you pay full price.  I think the offer price should be locked in at the time of order.  Sainsbury's prefer to claw back what is sometimes just a few pennies.  Is that legal?Date of experience: August 13, 2020",1

Nick,GB,"Jul 27, 2020","Never, ever use Sainsbury's home deliveryNever, ever shop online with Sainsbury's.Firstly they missed out 2 items from my home delivery without telling me or offering a substitute (clearly 4pts of milk and some Greek yogurt are tough to find subs for), despite emailing in the morning saying everything was in stock.I decided to do an online refund claim to save me calling them. I asked for the cash back because a voucher is useless if I don't intend on using them again. It then says they have to call you back to do it over the phone rather than putting it back onto the card you paid with. Fine. However 4 days later I get an email with a voucher code on it. I therefore have to call them up and spend 12 minutes on hold to get through to someone called Nadia who takes my details but can't actually help. She says she'll transfer me to the refund team but then manages to cut me off!I then have to call again (15mins on hold) and finally speak to someone else and then get transfered to the refund person (a short additional hold) who finally took my details and I'll get my money in 3-5 days, at least a week after they took it wrongfully in the first place.Never will I use Sainsbury's delivery again.Date of experience: July 27, 2020",1
Taylor,GB,"Jul 24, 2020","Lack of elderly dignity and carePoorest customer service against elderly I have seen.Firstly for 7 deliveries in a row my 80-year-old grandmothers incontinent pads have been delivered without bags and left on her doorstep, leaving her in tears every single time, sometimes they have even come damaged. Along with the fact that you rarely send the correct orders it seems like your staff simply want to put anything in the delivery to fulfil the requirements. They deliver her shopping without bags and watched an elderly slumped over lady have to unpack her stuff one by one on the doorstep. (I guess compassion is not a requirement for Sainsbury’s)I have called up about the situation seven times. Three of which I have been told an online manager will call me back the following day and has not made contact. A message to head office has been sent a message for the online manager x3 has been left and many many more phone calls.  The worst thing is the last time I called the individual that picked up the phone stated they were aware of the situation but yet no one had called me back!!!!!!!!( this can’t be denied as calls are recorded)I am shocked and appalled that a woman’s dignity has been defiled and it is not a priority for the online manager to call and resolve the situation especially as Sainsbury’s appeal to that age group of people. Add that to the fact that my grandmother is so loyal to the shop they are losing a lifetime customer. If you’re reading this review I’m not sure if this is the company for you if customer service and quality is important. As I work in Management I’m fully aware of how important it is, to preserve customer satisfaction, each of these online managers, for the past 3 days have intentionally ignored customer complaints and the requirements of the job to contact these people it says a lot about this company.Date of experience: July 24, 2020",1
