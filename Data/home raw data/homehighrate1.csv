Jeff Reber,US,"Oct 26, 2024","A True Problem Solver!Ann Marie was fantastic!  I had an 8 year old 3-bulb home bathroom fixture with no manufacturer name or ID number on it.  And none of the 3 bulbs showed a manufacturer or ID number either!  Once I explained the situation she asked a couple of quick questions and immediately determined the current bulbs had an E11 base.  She then sent me to their website and guided me through a drill down search to a page displaying multiple options that she was also looking at.  After discussing additional size and illumination specifications alongside each photo there, we both agreed on the best option.  And upon receipt they fit perfectly!  It was a small $57 order that took a lot of her time, but she was extremely knowledgeable, patient, eager to help, and friendly throughout.  Kudos to Bulbs.com for having such a professional salesperson on staff!  I encourage you to ask for her the next time you call.  Jeff R.Date of experience: October 17, 2024",5

Reine Parsons,US,"Dec 7, 2024","Bathroom Light Fixture BulbsOne of my bathroom light fixture bulbs had burned out, but the other two remained illuminated.  I went to the big box hardware stores looking for as close of a match as I could to the one that burned out, but I could not find anything.  I tried a regular bulb, but it just did not look right and it stuck out a little bit farther than the other two.Buying lightbulbs used to be easy but now it’s pretty painstaking to make sure you get the right one for the right fixture with the right wattage, lumens, Is it halogen?, Is it an LED?, etc.Finally, I had enough and I did a Google search and I found this wonderful company, bulbs.com.  I called them and a young gentleman answered the phone and I told him my situation gave him all the information off the burned out bulb. We talked about what kind of color light that the other two bulbs present and long story short, this person that I talked to on Monday, December 2, 2024, got me hooked up with the correct bulb that I need and I ordered 12 of them that way I can have them should any of the other bulbs in my bathrooms burn out I will have the replacements on hand.I can’t remember his name, but he hooked me up with the correct bulb, an  LED 9W/60W, A19, 800 lumens/brightness, 3000K soft white light appearance and the bulb is frosted. The bulb also has that hard coating part that takes up the lower half of the bulb as well.He gave me the information, I went online, I ordered the 12 and about four days later FedEx was handing them to me in my driveway.  If I ever need another lightbulb for my new construction townhome again, bulbs.com is the only place I’m going to go.  The person that helped me was so genuine and so professional and so sweet and so caring, and he really was drilling down and asking me a lot of questions to make sure that he got me the right lightbulb for my light fixture and so for that, I am eternally grateful.  I think bulbs.com is exactly what we need more of in this country in terms of online retailers.  I’m very happy I found them online. I’m even happier that I made the phone call to the company and I’m thrilled that I don’t have to worry about light bulbs for my bathrooms for about eight years. Keep up the great work and thank you.Date of experience: December 02, 2024",5
