I responded letting them know that I thought I was receiving one fire blanket and I have received nothing.  I was also charged for two blankets. I told them I no longer want any fire blankets and requested a refund for all payments made.  The bottom line is that Prepared Hero's apologized for the confusion and stated that they would refund both charges to me credit card account.Date of experience: October 29, 2024",5
Victoria,US,3 days ago,"Potential disaster diverted with our Prepared Hero ClothI purchased Prepared Hero for each of our daughter’s families for Christmas a year ago. Of course I got one for our home as well.While a son-in-law (contractor) was replacing a microwave above our gas stove, our daughter was helping. To keep any debris from getting into the cracks and crevices of our stove top we covered it with a handy dandy drop cloth.Very soon after the work began we all smelled gas!! Our daughter got off the stove top, where she had been “laying” to help with said microwave. There was a small hole in the drop cloth that was being burned. Obviously we had bumped the burner knob which turned on & we had a little fire. Little because I immediately grabbed my Prepared Hero cloth which did what it was created to do. Although the flame was small, it could have been a disaster. Again, thank you for selling to wonderful product!!Victoria (Vicki) SmithDate of experience: April 15, 2024",5

I have been waiting for my order since Dec 12th and the only response I get is that they are working on it and demand was high. I have emailed CS five times and every time I get the exact same email back -  ""Due to extremely high demand, we're experiencing a larger-than-expected volume of orders. Rest assured, our team is working around the clock to ship your order as quickly as possible."" That's it. Nothing answering any of the questions I specifically ask, no additional phone numbers or other paths of resolution offered. I hope everyone reads through reviews before buying this product. I really regret giving this company my money. I can't even get a hold of them to initiate a refund. And the additional fun part is that i keep getting emails from them asking me to rate my experience or buy additional products even though I unsubscribed from promo emails.

So I felt a little safer in my house.But while walking in the park a man confronted me about of all things the hat I was wearing.It belonged to my late husband and I just like to wear it. it was for a sports team that is not the local club.This man was angry and called me something terrible. I was legitimately afraid of him.I was able to walk away because the park was fairly crowded. But I started thinking about how often I’m hiking in a more isolated area. I have a dog but she’s fairly passive. So I began carrying both pepper spray and a large pocket knife.I felt a little better but then I considered what would happen if those were to be taken from me. And also whether I would actually be able to hurt another person even under duress since I’ve never trained for that.So now I carry the defense alarm.I’m now confident I can at least startle a person with bad intentions and hopefully get some help.I’m not going to give up walking in parks.I am going to take reasonable steps to keep myself safe.I ordered some for my sisters and friends as well.Date of experience: November 26, 2024",5

When I go to pull up my order confirmation the 4 pack of emergency fire blankets still says preparing for shipping. Very frustrating that it has been now 16 days and I haven’t received my order or an update. I have reached out to the email listed(which I keep getting message saying undeliverable, so that doesn’t work), the phone number listed to contact (but just keep getting a recording that says high volume of calls so to email the same email that hasn’t been working and then call says, goodbye and hangs up), messaged them on Instagram and Facebook with same message to email support@preparedhero  that doesn’t work and I also messaged on contact form on website and no one has responded.  So they charged me for 6 blankets, they’ve been paid for but 4 have not shipped yet. I would think it was a total scam if I hadn’t received 2 blankets quickly.  Customer service is horrible and communication with company impossible. I was excited to have and recommend your blanket but I am changing my mind. I want to get my order handled and receive what I have already paid for. I would not recommend because of this issue. Date of experience: December 21, 2024",1

I ended up calling my bank and cancelled the order, since I couldn't get a response from the company. Finally, I hear from them that they cancelled the order due to a dispute from my bank.

Please note that you’ll need to cover the return shipping cost.Once we receive your return, we’ll let you know if it’s approved. If so, the refund will be processed within 3-5 business days.But we’d love to offer some options to skip the hassle of returning it and add extra value for you!

No need to send anything back, and your credit will be valid for 2 years. Plus, you get to keep the product!Option 2 – Keep the Item + DiscountGet an immediate refund of $40.00 and keep the item.

We’re here to make this easy and ensure you have a great experience with us.--Thank you for Preparing to be a Hero!The above is what I received from Prepared Hero, but only after posting my dissatisfaction on Trust Pilot. I find their approach to dealing with requests for refunds are the tactics of an unethical company by offering 40% of the purchase price for you to go away, not their 30 day money back guarantee on their website. I replied to their email offering $40 and to keep the two pens, one that won’t charge the battery and the other one that must be within an inch to detect the signal of a cell phone.

WessMcD,US,"Dec 31, 2024","Missing in Action… Order and Support On Dec 10th I placed an order for 12 Prepared Hero blankets to give as Christmas gifts for several family members. The cutoff date for ordering in time for Christmas delivery was Dec 12th according to their website, which I chose to order from directly instead of ordering through Amazon. I thought it would be a kind jester to the company to order direct and cut out the middle man. Upon ordering I received a confirmation email stating I would receive shipping information soon. After a week of no updates, I emailed the support team asking for an update and immediately received an automated response stating not to worry that my order was being processed and that all orders placed before 12/12 we’re guaranteed to arrive before Christmas. To date (12/30/24), no additional updates have been provided and the order has still not arrived, despite daily emails sent to their support line asking for order status. Today I received an email from Prepared Hero asking for a review, so I’m hoping that sharing my disappointing and frustrating experience will invoke a response from the company and let me know when I can expect to receive my very late order and be able to give my very late gifts to those I love.Date of experience: December 30, 2024",1
Barbara Ducharme,US,Updated 2 days ago,"Disappointed but still hopeful.UPDATE:  MY PACKAGE FINALLY ARRIVED!!  I feel that it's only fair that I now respond on a more positive note.  My fear that this was a scam has been put to rest.  Although the package arrived two weeks after Christmas (delivery had been guaranteed by December 24) I can now provide my family with a gift that I hope they will never have to use.  My only suggestion to Prepared Hero is that you provide updates when shipments will be delayed. Responses to my multiple emails would have been appreciated.ADDITIONAL COMMENT:Regarding the response from Prepared Hero...I have NOT heard from any of your customer service agents. I have sent 2 separate emails and have not received an answer to either one.  Could you please include his/her response here?  All I'm looking for is the date that my order will be shipped and when I will receive it.Like some other reviews I've seen here, I'm starting to fear that this is a scam.  I ordered 12 fire blankets on December 12 and immediately received a confirmation email with an order number.  These were intended to be Christmas gifts for my entire family.  I knew I was cutting it close but was still hopeful.  I tried calling Prepared Hero on December 20.  A recorded message said they were experiencing heavy call volume and that I might receive a quicker response by email.  No option to stay on hold.  The end of the message also said ""we guarantee delivery by December 24 for all orders sent by December 16"". I sent an email but received no answer. Christmas came and went....no gifts for my family.  I sent a second email yesterday and I'm anxiously awaiting a response.Another reason that I'm suspicious is that MY CREDIT CARD WAS CHARGED ON THE DAY OF THE ORDER!  I try to be understanding of the pressure that retailers face during the holidays but I don't think a response is too much to ask.Date of experience: December 10, 2024",1

I emailed them on December 16 asking what was happening (because it just said my order was 'confirmed') and they claimed to ""guarantee"" delivery still by December 24. Not sure how that's possible when my order doesn't even say it's ready. Then I get a sales email on December 22 saying ""order on Amazon for delivery by Christmas."" So they can ship via Amazon in 2 days?? Even if I wanted to do this just to receive it, the only option for one blanket on Amazon $108 which is WAY more than the ones off their site (my entire Dec 03 order including shipping was $27).

Eileen D.,US,"Dec 23, 2024","Ordered 8 Fire Blankets/Rec'd 4 - Customer Service came to the RescueI recently ordered 8 Fire Blankets from Prepared Hero. The order was shipped out quickly but upon receipt, there were only 4 Fire Blankets in the box.  I first tried to call the company but there was a problem getting through on the number listed in their advertisement (this made me a little worried). I then found an email address and proceeded to write to them.   I'll admit, when I did not see a reply email from them the next day, I started to wonder if this was all a scam. Not being too tech savvy, I had forgotten that sometimes emails land in the Spam file by accident.  The next day I checked my Spam file and sure enough, there was the reply that they had sent to me the day before.  They apologized for any problem that I was having. They asked if I could send them photos of the labels on my package and take a photo of how they were packaged in the box. I did everything they asked of me, and sent the email back. The very next day they contacted me saying they were very sorry this had happened and they would send out my additional Fire Blankets right away. Wow, that was painless. I mean, I was hoping they weren't going to give me a hard time, as I really couldn't ""prove"" that I only rec'd 4 of the 8 blankets ordered. A few days went by and I rec'd another email saying there might be a slight delay in my receiving my package due to the volume of orders they were currently processing. Understandable, I was happy they took the time to notify me of that.  I am pleased to announce that on Dec. 21st, I rec'd the other 4 Fire Blankets that they owed me.  I had read many reviews on this company before ordering and I will say, there were plenty of great reviews but there were also some that made me a little skeptical. So when I did not receive the amount of blankets that I ordered, I was priming for a fight.  However, that was not the case. I was very pleased with the way they handled my ""complaint"".  They were efficient and professional. I worked in customer service for 20 years so I know how things should go and how they could go.  In my case, Prepared Hero handled things the way they should be handled ... and I thank them for it. I will be gifting these to several family members during the Holidays, with hopes that they never need it!!!Date of experience: December 05, 2024",5
