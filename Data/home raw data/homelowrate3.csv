Amy Mach,US,3 days ago,"INTERIOR ICONS WONT DELIVER THE REST OF MY ORDER.I've ordered the Saga table in dark emperador marble for over 6 months now. My order was delayed twice, and finally when it was being delivered, I ONLY received the base of my table. I'm missing the whole table top within my order. I speak to AIT (the delivery company) daily, and they reassure daily that they have not received the 2nd shipment of my order (the table top) and only received the base. They've also emailed Interior Icons from their end and also receive no response. I email the support email at Interior Icons and only have been told that ""this is escalated to management and someone will reach out"". It has been 2 weeks and no one has reached out. I'm not sure why there is no accountability taken. This is the most ive spent on a dining table, and it shows that this table is in stock. Interior Icons--PLEASE SEND ME ANOTHER TABLE TOP. That is the only thing that's needed to fix this order.Date of experience: December 31, 2024",1

E Ez,US,21 hours ago,"SCAMMER ALERT!!! REPORT THIS COMPANY AS SCAM. INTERIOR ICONS is a total SCAM. Please DO NOT ORDER anything with this company. Although their website looks legitimate, reviews are FAKE. I will explain to you how they are operating and making their money: So when you order furniture, technically you are bound to exchange ONLY. What they do is they will intentionally send you damaged furniture, and then you have to reject the item and have them process a replacement. So first strike is: They over charge you on shipping over $150 dollars. Then they send you shattered-broken-damaged items that they won’t refund you on and they will only offer a replacement that will take a couple of months and most likely it will be damaged again. They also do not respond to any emails. I requested a cancelation on a pre-order that was never canceled. Btw this happens to pretty much every single costumer. It’s their tactic. I found a website with customers reviews. Just google Interior icons reviews.  There is no phone number and their costumer service will only communicate with you up until they say they processed your replacement and they will stop after that. I also can assure you the furniture designers are not the few folks from Seattle in the photo they put on their website.  INTERIOR ICONS STOP Scamming. I’m in a process of taking legal actions so nobody else becomes a victim of fraudsters like them. I made a few phone calls and sent out a few emails. Please EVERYONE continue reporting them to your financial institution. I personally have reported them to major creditors and they are in a process of flagging them. Soon their website will be taken down. INTERIOR ICONS, DO NOT  respond to this review. Your responses are INVALID. Trust Pilot please contact me directly and I’m happy to provide you with all the evidence-information needed. You need to FLAG them as well. Thank you Trustpilot!

Jamie S,US,"Updated Jan 2, 2025","BewareBeware. They have an F Rating from the BBB. I ordered 4 barstools. While it showed in stock, they didn’t ship for 10-15 days. When they arrived the boxes were damaged and every leg of the stools was sticking out of the box. And of course every stool was damaged because of this including some bent legs. They made me unbox them and kept asking for photos over and over again. Then after all that they wanted a video. ALSO NOTE that they do NOT have a phone number. This is all done through frustrating emails. Once I took them out of the boxes I realized how poorly they were packaged. Heavy barstools in flimsy boxes with minimal packing to protect them. This wasn’t a FedEx issue it was an Interior Icons packaging problem. I told them I didn’t want them replaced because it would clearly happen again if that’s how they ship. They refused and said I was required to take a replacement. Now it’s been another 10 days and no shipping etc. I also filed a complaint with BBB and they got back to me that Interior Icons is NOT responding to BBB which it says on the site is normal for this company. I will never buy from them again. I will also be refusing the shipment if the boxes show up damaged again. The kicker on all this is I now have to dispose of 4 large barstools because Interior Icons said that I’m responsible for disposal. All this company needed to do was accept my request to cancel my order. I’ve been posting the link to BBB on their Facebook ads but they keep deleting it. lol. Apparently they’re well aware of their poor customer service because it’s hard to find a place to leave them a review. They control the reviews shown on their website and that’s why they’re all positive. UPDATE: FedEx attempted to deliver the replacements today but the boxes arrived damaged just like the first time.

When I had to move from Arizona to be near my family in September, I notified Interior Icons, and they sent me a note indicating that they'd updated the delivery address to my new home in CT.  However, they did not do that, and all three lamps were sent to Tucson where the new home owner refused them. I engaged in a series of email conversations with customer service reps, but there is NO PHONE for a customer to contact Interior Icons, and the help they offered was really just no help at all. They offered $75 off a future order. Believe me, there will be no future order. Having read other reviews of Interior Icons, I realize I will be lucky if the remaining two lamps show up at all. They sent me a survey to rate their customer service, but it only offered a smiley face or a frowning face. This service was too terrible to let them off the hook that easily.

Nico M,US,"Updated Feb 19, 2024","Poor quality controlI ordered a coffee table from Interior Icons. The shipment was significantly delayed but it did eventually arrive. While they did an excellent job of carefully packing the table, they did not do a good job of quality control--the table I received had scuff marks and a bubble in the laminate on the top. They gave me the choice of a $50 refund or to send me a new table--I chose the new table. The new table arrived in even worse condition than the first--the table had the same scuffs on the top, and the side of the table had a clearly visible diagonal crack stretching from the top to the bottom. I would not order from this company again.Additionally, the company's comment below makes no sense - I provided the order number they gave me and the email address where I exchanged dozens of emails with their customer support team.

Second one came two months later- and if possible was in WORSE condition. I demanded a refund. They refused. Told me to read the fine print- they aren't responsible for damage in transit. I'm the consumer- why should I bear that responsibility!!?? They are in the business of delivering to consumers. Bottom line, they suck- can't talk to a human. Only a bop.

Celia Black,US,"Sep 14, 2024","Deceptive Company with Terrible Customer Service – Avoid Interior Icons!I am incredibly disappointed with my experience with Interior Icons, particularly with their Mouille Ceiling Lamp. When the lamp arrived, it was damaged, and the process to get a refund or replacement has been a nightmare. There is no phone number to reach a real person—just an unhelpful chatbot. I immediately uploaded photos of the damage and requested instructions on how to return the item for a refund. Two days later, I received an email from ""Jennifer"" (via ZenDesk), asking for more photos of the entire lamp and the original packaging. She informed me that refunds aren't allowed for damage during transit—really?I complied and sent the additional photos, and two days later, I was told I could only get a replacement, but I could return the second one if I wasn’t satisfied. Frustrated but still hopeful, I requested a replacement. Then, nothing. Ten days passed before I received an email from ""Mathew"" (again via ZenDesk), stating they had determined from the first set of photos that there was “no damage” (which is blatantly false) and that they would not send a replacement. At this point, I don’t even want the replacement—I just want my money back!This company is frustrating, dishonest, and misleading. They claim their products are handcrafted in their own factory, but the box clearly says ""Made in China."" Their website shows photos of Caucasian craftspeople making the furniture, which is deceptive since the items ship from China. It’s beyond infuriating. Buyer beware—I will NEVER purchase from Interior Icons again!Date of experience: September 03, 2024",1
A.,US,"Feb 26, 2024","Misleading shipping options and general lack of good faith I wanted to buy a marble plinth/cube side table from them during a sale they had going on. The reviews mentioned getting white glove delivery was worth it because it weighs over 100lb, so I was confused when I didn’t see white glove delivery as an option at checkout. I reached out to them to clarify if I was doing something wrong. The problems arose when:1) they told me the only way to get white glove delivery for this (130lb) side table was to order other even larger items—so basically I’d have to spend thousands to get any help with delivery. 2) this took several back and forth messages to get the above answer from them—at which point their sale was no longer happening, and they refused to honor the price I’d seen in my cart when I first reached out. Seems like in this case, it’s in their best interest to reply slowly. The fact that a 130lb marble cube isn’t heavy enough to warrant offering the white glove option that they have is wild. The fact they try to extort you for more money in order to have it be an option is disappointing/downright irresponsible.

customer,US,"Updated May 22, 2024","Deceitful, Questionable Business Practices My experience is that this company sells inferior quality goods. I would never shop from this company!  Using google search, Interior Icons links their website to advertise designer names which makes it “appear” that they sell designer goods for a competitive price; however, the goods they sell imitate the designer items, the items are not authentic and are of inferior quality.  Example - searching for Philippe Starck Kartell chairs, Interior Icon has the “Masters” chair for sale - but they in fact do NOT sell authentic Kartell Masters chairs, even though they go to the extent to link their website to a search for the designer and name their products the EXACT SAME NAME as the designer.  If a company wants to sell goods that “look” like designer goods but are NOT designer goods why would you name your products the exact same name unless it is to trick the customer - that is a deceitful business practice.  How is it legal to sell items that copy the designer, have the same name as the designer, but are NOT by the designer.  BEWARE! Shop elsewhere.

All the items in the order were ""in stock"" and ""ready to ship in 2 days from Seattle"". Not only they weren't shipped in 2 days or 2 business days: I received 1 chair in almost a month in a tumbled box + my coffee table. In the box the chair was wrapped in 3rd grade plastic with multiple corners and parts of the chair sticking out of the plastic, finish already scratching off of the chair. When I unwrapped the chair I discovered that the glue was sticking from in between the seams. The surface of wood is uneven, the finish is scratched and simply low quality. I'm still waiting for 5 of my chairs out of the 6 I ordered. The company doesn't have a phone number they only reply to your emails if they feel like it. The shipping company has 4 out of 5 chairs and they called me, but it looks like nobody knows where the 5th chair is and nobody cares. I actually looked at the packing  list and it was clearly indicated that there were only 5 chairs there as soon as the order was shipped and I emailed them about it but they replied in general terms of ""we'll handle it"". They are still handling it or so it seems. The travertine table was simply ok for the price that's why it's not 1 star but 2. High quality packaging on the table: comes in a wooden crate. It looks like they're getting away with low quality of products and customer support by a pretty website and low prices. I guess you get what you pay for.

I ordered the Dante Marble Table in July, opting for white glove delivery at an extra cost. However, when the delivery arrived in November, they had discontinued white glove service without informing me. I had to refuse the delivery of three heavy crates, one weighing 659 lbs and the others 214 lbs each.After much frustration, Interior Icons agreed to reimburse the shipping costs but left me to find a local company for white glove delivery at my expense. Over a month later, the table arrived damaged, in more than six pieces due to a poor delivery job by AGS (Associated Global Systems). They are sending a replacement, but I'm stuck with the removal of a 600+ lbs crate, which will be costly and they refuse to assume the cost.The customer service is conducted exclusively via email, with no phone support available.

Matthias Schmitt,US,"Updated Jan 7, 2024","Red Herring Return PolicyI was attracted to their generous return policy and variety of furniture pieces. I ordered a leather chair with an Ottoman. The boxes arrived with FedEx. I had to cut open the box, otherwise, the chair would not have come out. I sat it in, and the leather was too hard, so I decided to return it. The company told me since the box was cut that they cannot accept a return. I looked at the box with an LTL shipper. The box can only be opened by cutting open the side. The chair was placed in the middle of the box and the sides were stapled together with an industrial stapler. What Interior Icons are putting in your terms and conditions is not only detrimental to the customer but also a setup and an impossible hurdle to pass as part of their 365-day return warranty. Their return policy, seemingly generous at first, is on a second look, a red herring that lures clients into purchasing from them and then, when they refuse the return, leaves you stuck with items. Then they suggest you sell those items on your own! Given that they offer you a paltry discount for items you do not like, this is a highly profitable business for them.Other furniture companies let you return items, and they even send out a company to pick them up. I cannot recommend ordering from Interior Icons.I am updating my review based on II's reply:Your customer service response was unacceptable, as was your reply. The box for the furniture is stapled in a way that it is impossible to get the furniture out without damaging the box.

Well 24 to 48 hour e-mail replies to my urgent requests for shipping information combined with “excuses” (there’s no dedicated 800 # so if you have a question get ready to wait for an answer 24 - 48 hrs) Monday’s to Friday’s 8 am to 5 pm only, just doesn’t cut it in my book when one is purchasing big ticket items from their store. For this reason I cancelled a $6,399.45 order within 24 hrs of having placed it & I left them a scathing review here on TrustPilot that I’ve since deleted because to their credit they did as of 11/17/2023 fully refund my money. Thank you Emma. Now …I am however still waiting on a relatively small Order # SJ58595 (Eileen Side Table - $328.00) to show up in Interior Icons tracking portal as having been “shipped” — 7 days after placing this order it’s still not on its way to me yet but when I bought it the table showed as “in stock” & ready to ship? What gives Emma? Robert? When I made this purchase on 11/13/23 your website strongly implied that the Eileen Side Table would ship out via Fed Ex within 2 days? Whats the holdup?Please don’t make me cancel another order‼️Update…My Eileen Side Table arrived (without printed instructions as to how to put it together🙄). It’s a lovely high quality product. I’m pleased HOWEVER the hassle Interior Icons has put me through since I placed my orders on 11/12/2023 are hardly worth it. I will never purchase anything else from this company & I strongly suggest if you are considering buying from them that you do your due diligence — I UNFORTUNATELY didn’t until AFTER I’d placed my orders.

Lucas Dias-Lam,US,"Oct 11, 2023","TWICE the item came damagedI ordered this item (the Arlo Wall Light) and the first time it arrived (9/26), the piece connecting the bulb base to the lamp arm was broken. This meant the wire inside were showing and the bulb would dangle back and forth like a pendulum whenever the arm was swung. I reached out to customer support and to their credit they were immediately helpful, offering a small refund or to replace the item. I opted for the replacement and it was promptly ordered and arrived 10/10. This time, the bulb base was fine but for some odd reason the wooden ball on the bottom of the arm was missing. I opened the box and saw it was not there, but figured it was somewhere inside the box so I could at least super glue it together, but it just wasn't in the box. If I had to give the customer support a rating it would be 5/5, but considering this product came damaged twice I think the problem is with their procurement/shipping/packaging group. I would not order something that is overly large from here again just because I don't trust the shipping, especially since the shipping charge on the original order was $99 (although shipping on the replacement was free).

Chris,US,"Sep 29, 2023","Item NOT as advertised AND refund refusedI purchased a sofa from this company several months ago and it's been a horribly disappointing experience. I only had to sit in it for 30 seconds to figure out that the construction and measurements aren't as advertised. There clearly aren't any springs in the construction, after only a brief inspection, and back height is significantly shorter than listed (21% shorter in fact).I understand that not everyone likes every product, and things can get missed in the manufacturing process, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and reached out for a refund. That only seems fair...I've been in customer service purgatory ever since. They claim that items aren't eligible for return if they aren't in their original packaging. However, sofas are shipped with wooden slats supporting the boxes so it's impossible to open the box without damaging the packaging. Their terms are quite frankly invalid and unenforceable for sofas and other large items.I just followed up with customer service again to try to get to a reasonable resolution where I pay UPS to professionally freight package the item for return. I'm not hopeful for a reasonable response given the very poor level of customer service so far. Again, the item is completely unused and in perfect condition. All I want is my money back. I didn't even want to leave this review - I'm holding out a sliver of hope that someone else at the company looks at these reviews.I'm beyond disappointed and I'm exploring legal/banking solutions due to fraud as the item is materially different from what is advertised, without a proper return channel, and it appears they wipe any negative reviews off of their website. I'll update my review if I reach a resolution through their customer service.Date of experience: September 27, 2023",1

I was sent this email: ""We would first like to offer you a partial refund of $100 as a goodwill gesture if you would like to keep your order."" - This made me uncomfortable. I didn't feel they were listening to me since I stated the bar stools were too tall in my email. I emailed again and stated please send return instructions. Here were the requirements sent to me: ""Please upload 5 images: 1x of the entire original box, 4x images of the product.*In order for us to accept your return request, please upload images of the unused products) in perfect condition. Please include an image showing each original and undamaged product box with the product inside it, and 4 images showing each returned product from different angles. Please ensure that the entire item and box are shown in each picture, and show all items in each picture.""The requirements seemed excessive and I interpreted it as a way of putting up obstacles to impede returns and the vendor taking no responsibility for their items. I had 3 bar stools, was I supposed to follow the instructions above for all 3 even though I only opened one box? Their site only allowed for 5 photos max on top of that but based on the verbaige above I needed to take photos of all items. They mentioned ""show original and undamaged box"" - one of their boxes arrived in less than stellar condition, so was I responsible for this?Basically, everything in their language gave me the impression that getting a refund would be a battle.

The items themselves are quite low quality - I ordered the spindle clock which looks great in the pictures on the website but was exceptionally low quality for a $300 item... loud and cheap quartz movement (you can hear the ticking noise across the room), flimsy hands that bend easily, and the spindles themselves aren't even attached symmetrically. I also ordered the Petra chair and a tripod plant stand... both of these are higher quality than the clock, but they have their own issues. For instance, the tripod plant stand was glued together messily and you can see the glue dripping out from the seams in the wood. Agree with other reviewers on this site... DO NOT trust the reviews on the Interior Icons site. They clearly screen their reviews and other than responding to an email survey (which will inevitably be screened before it's posted), I don't see any way to actually submit an honest review on their site.

Shipping was supposed too be received before August 15.  It was not received and they said they were awaiting receipt in their warehouse.  I asked why their website indicates they have 9 in-stock, when they have to receive it from somewhere else.  In reality, the products are made in China and shipped somewhere else, then shipped from that location.  BEWARE: the reviews on their website are all good because they screen them and the goods are not made by craftspeople as the stock images on their site show.  I cannot even tell where this company is located...It is now September 1 and my order says it will ship in 12-16 weeks, but they told me I would received by September 15.  I'll check back in and cancel if not received in-hand by 9/15.UPDATE 9/20/23I received both chairs now at 2 different locations.That being said, the chairs are really amazing, stunning and very substantial quality!  Please understand, I thought maybe your site was a scam when I started looking at it thoroughly after placing my order and believed I may be getting strung along.  There are many scam sites out there and not having a customer service phone is a great drawback.I am a owner of multiple businesses and believe you have to have the entire package to be successful.  If you go into a fabulous restaurant that has the most incredible food, but the lighting is bad, music sucks, service pretentious, bad or whatever, then it is an overall poor experience.  The chef may be the best in the world but the restaurant fails.  I must say, your product is amazing and the price point very good and I’m very satisfied with that.  Your communication was good, but the 24 hour response did not help my fears Interior Icons was some sort of scam.  Also, the reviews online outside of your website, were providing a very different perspective relative to the ones on your website.

Shipping and return cost almost as much as the lamp itself. Loss for the client and embarrassment for me. Do not recommend.

Ayanna Smith,US,"Updated Aug 4, 2023","Beautiful ChairsFirst, let me say that I read these reviews AFTER I made my purchase and they had my nerves really bad.I started to email them about my order regularly for status updates.The order came as planned.I will say that I honestly don’t think these chairs will stand up to daily use. They seem to be made out of cheap wool and not stitched well but they’re beautiful. Also, they’re very itchy to sit in and the lumbar area feels like it’s missing support.I told the family to avoid them. We will use them when we have guests only. They’re a legit company with beautiful products but I can’t speak to the quality just yet. From my experience the quality feels a bit off but again, aesthetically they’re beautiful.Date of experience: July 29, 2023",4

Casey,US,"Updated Jul 18, 2023Verified","What A Terrible Experience We've Had!!I cannot begin to tell you how absolutely AWEFUL our experience has been ordering through Interior Icons.  First off, you they do not list a number for you to call, so the ONLY way to communicate with this company is via email, which is crazy.  When communicating via email, they seem to care less about the customer and their individual experience.  We've repeatedly requested our money back and just to move on, however, Interior Icons has refused this time and time again.  Here is a little bit about our overall experience.  Even though it may appear to be a great value and exactly what you're looking for, I would urge you to STAY CLEAR of this company, as they are a complete sham...We ordered a table, which said ""Available For Shipment"" on November 2nd, 2022.  We only ordered it because we wanted to have it prior to Thanksgiving.  HOWEVER, this is how they get you.  We kept following up on the table, but apparently it wasn't even available, so here we are waiting for the table, which did not end up arriving until the next year.  Once it did arrive, the delivery company they are contracted with did not have any supplies necessary to deliver the table.  We literally had to provide them with gloves, sheets to protect our wood flooring, screwdrivers to open the box the tulip table came in, etc.. They then drug the heavy box(marble top) into our home and made a large approximately 15' gash in our wood flooring.  The delivery people were very nice and they are taking care of that damage, however, we cannot say the same for Interior Icons.  Once the delivery guys opened the box, the top was cracked all of the way through, so here we are again waiting for this darn table.  After COUNTLESS emails to this same person(Emma, if he/she even exists), we received notification that the base is shipping, BUT they still don't know when the top will be available.  They literally wanted us to accept deliver of half of what we ordered and then just store it in our home on their behalf, which we refused to do and requested that they ship the order in full, which makes sense.  During this entire time and the absolutely awful experience we've had with this order, we've requested time and time again to just cancel the entire thing and move on.  However, Interior Icons has refused to do this and they are shoving this order down our throats.  They then said that we could return it(once it came in), but we'd only get 80 percent of the amount back in return.  My wife when receiving a call form the delivery company, refused the order and had the items sent back to Interior Icons. However, they are now saying that since we didn't accept the delivery, we are now only getting 50 percent back. TRULY UNBELIEVABLE!  Please I beg this of you, pay the additional money to find a QUALITY company to purchase from, one that truly cares about the customer and their experience.  We are easy people to work with, and this is BY FAR the worst experience we've ever had.  IF we could get someone on the phone(WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO), I believe we could then work this out.  However, they hide behind their email and quick responses referencing ""terms"" that nobody ever reads. Just crazy..... STAY CLEAR OF INTERIOR ICONSDate of experience: November 01, 2022",1
Kate Jackson Group,US,"Updated Jul 17, 2023","Absolutely TERRIBLE Experience!!!Absolutely HORRIBLE experience!  Prior to submitting a formal review, we've attempted everything possible to have our issues with our order resolved, however here we still are nine moths later.  We ordered a dining room table on November 2, 2022, when it finally was delivered months later, the delivery company they hired didn't have the proper tools and equipment to deliver the dining room table we had ordered. We had to provide them with the tools necessary(gloves, moving towels to protect floor, screwdrivers etc.), and upon bringing it into the home the delivery company scratched our entry wood floors running from our front door to our Dining Room, leaving a mark of approximately 15 feet in length. Upon opening the shipment, the table was damaged, so back again to waiting for another table to arrive.  They requested that we take shipment of the base only, but would then need to wait on the actual top since it was still unavailable.  What?!?  They then told us that if we were to refuse shipment, we would be charged a 20 percent re-stocking fee.  Upon refusing the shipment, we then receive another email stating that per the terms, we could see up to a 50 percent restocking fee.  Truly unbelievable, to say the least.  We have requested time and time again to have our money fully refunded, which is the right thing to do, considering the experience we've had.  Interior Icons can research all the email history for this. Absolutely awful, I can't say enough bad things about how this overall experience was ordering through interior icons. You can't even talk to a live person on the phone, everything is handled via email. BE AWARE, go somewhere else to buy something you're looking for!THIS WAS THERE REPLY....Hello there,Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback. This helps us understand the areas that need improvement, and we will work toWe were sorry to see that your order took on some damage during the transit from Seattle, WA. We understand that a replacement of the damaged item was declined, as your preference was to proceed with a return and we can see that you are already in discussion with our team in regard to this. We look forward to continuing the conversation with you. Please be assured we will continue to work with you to make this right.-The Interior Icons TeamMY REPLY....Wonderful, how do we have this said ""conversation"".  The ONLY way to reach you guys is via email, which typically offers absolutely ZERO help.  Interior Icons hides behind the ""terms listed on their website"", however, you all use this in a way to completely take advantage of a customer.  Since the original shipment was damaged and the delivery company did major damage to the wood floors in our home, we  have requested time and time again to just cancel the darn order and move on.  However, you have refused to do this.  Since we refused the order, the shipment company sent those items back you, which you now have in your possession.  You are now saying since we did not accept the delivery and then use your ""portal"" to submit a return, we're now getting back 30 percent less that we would have if we had accepted the deliver.  This is absolutely CRAZY!  TO ANY POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS OF INTERIOR ICONS, EVEN THOUGH IT MAY APPEAR TO GREAT VALUE, IT IS NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE DEALING WITH THIS COMPANY.  UNLIKE A QUALITY COMPANY THAT DOES RIGHT BY THE CUSTOMER, THESE PEOPLE ARE A COMPLETE SHAM AND I WOULD ABSOLUTELY STEER CLEAR OF THEM.  WE ARE EASY PEOPLE TO WORK WITH, HOWEVER, THIS HAS BEEN THE ABSOLUTE WORST EXPERIENCE WE'VE EVER HAD ORDERING SOMETHING.  Also, for reference, here is the email we received so that I am above board.... Thank you for your emails.  Our returns fee only applies to return requests that have been made through our portal.  As you rejected the shipment, and did not submit a return request, we cannot honor a return fee, as the order is not classified as a return.  As advised previously and outlined in the terms and conditions of sale (which were agreed to at the time of purchase, ""In the event of a rejected delivery, Interior Icons will take responsibility for the return of the items, and a 50% restocking fee will be deducted from the refund processed. Please note that shipping charges are not able to be refunded once these services have been provided by our delivery partners.)"" Checking the box stating ""I agree with the terms and conditions"" at the time of purchase is deemed as you reading, understanding and accepting the full terms and conditions. As such, we cannot waive this fee.  Please let us know if you have any further questions and we will be happy to assist you.

Jude M,US,"Jul 9, 2023","Repeat buyer, always great qualityI love what your company offers, and have had great success with all my purchases.  Communication of purchase confirmation, shipping timeline and packing have all been excellent.  I even got the big arc lamp, and it was sent in two parts with understandable directions and packed well.   I do want to ask a question.  I had to pay shipping on my last purchase of the grasshopper lamp (I bought in stone) and was waiting for the July 4 sale to buy!  We are moving so money a little tight at the moment.  I went ahead and paid but it ate up the discount.  I haven’t yet received the lamp so wondered if the fee could be waived.  Has been the only fly in the ointment, so to speak.Date of experience: July 04, 2023",5

Paul Gurda,US,"Jul 3, 2023","Wagenfeld lamp replacementOrdering a replacement Wagenfeld lamp was easy and almost painless—the pain comes from having broken the globe on one of my lamps and then discovering that there’s no parts replacement option available. So I am glad I’ll still have a pair of matching lamps on my bedside tables, at a cost that probably isn’t more than double what I’d have paid to source a globe somewhere if I had the time to go to the trouble. The free shipping definitely made a difference in lessening my frustration.Date of experience: July 03, 2023",4

I should have trusted the negative reviews I read prior to placing my order. If I could give interior Icons zero stars I would. I ordered 12 clear victoria ghost chairs. I received the first shipment yesterday afternoon containing 6 chairs. Unfortunately, the quality of the chairs is terrible. They look cheap and wiggle. They are not stable. Not only that but I ordered clear chairs and they are most definitely not clear. All 6 chairs have a purple hue in several areas. In addition, one of the chairs is missing a piece at the bottom of one leg. I took pictures and promptly contacted the company. My request to return the chair has been denied due to the missing part! Also be aware that there is no number to call. If you have issues with your order you can only email them. Please save your money and buy furniture elsewhere.Date of experience: June 25, 2023",1
