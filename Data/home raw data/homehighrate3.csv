Michael Cohen,US,5 days agoVerified,"Amazing LED Strip Lights for my GreenhouseI am relatively new to LED strip lighting and selecting the product and accessories needed was made super simple by the staff of Solid Apollo LED that I worked with.

They were happy to help make recommendations that fit my needs for a large custom photo box. The prices are high but if you want quality lighting, it's going to cost.The best part about the experience is they provide all the specifications someone would want about the lights they are buying unlike most places that only highlight a few details.

Hap Tivey,US,"Dec 27, 2024Verified","Tech supportThe ordinary things that make an experience great for me are the ease of using the website, access to information about the products on the site and quick delivery. Solid Apollo excels at all three, but that isn't particularly uncommon for electronics. What sets Solid Apollo in its own class is its support for these products.  But a video camera from amazon and expect hours of marginal support for how to make it work. Buy a new iphone and expect to drive back to the Apple store to get help, or watch hours of youtube trying to trust who to trust. At Solid, I've hit snags understanding products before and after buying them. I call. I talk to someone in tech, recently Cameron. It's like getting real knowledge over the phone that's applicable. On one occasion I wanted to hack one of their new products to make it work as the older versions I used. They explained how to do that. Who does that? Who cares enough to do that? Yes, maybe a tech at the Apple store. For me that's a two hour drive, an afternoon. Imagine getting the same tech value with a phone call. That's Solid Apollo.Date of experience: November 26, 2024",5

Howard Skillington,US,"Dec 5, 2023Verified","A better quality optionWe did not trust the super-cheap alternatives that are readily available for LED lighting.  Too many reports of early failure.  This system's two year warranty and the good customer service we have gotten from Solid Apollo were decisive for us.  The installation was simple and went well.  It would be helpful if there was a longer option for an extension cable (female-to-female) between light pucks, junction box, control box, and power supply, depending upon your situation.  Also, the red LED on the control panel is quite bright, so you may want to put a piece of tape over it.  Other than that,  a good system and recommended.Date of experience: November 13, 2023",4

On top of already expensive LED strip ($90 for16ft LED strip), I was suggested by their sales person  to buy compatible transformer for another $195, that is also supposed to be dimmable. I got 2 of these LED strips and sales person insisted that I need 2 transformers for each 16 ft LED strip. My client did not mind the expenses. But. These transformers did not work with these LED's and were getting dangerously hot when connected. Our GC refused to install them for the fear of fire hazard. We wanted to return them, but it was beyond their 30 days return policy. Representative did not help out with any of these issues and we are now stuck with 2 unusable transformers, lost $400 for just trusting their ""expertise"".

I explained my project, and he patiently walked me through all the details—helping me choose the right light temperature, explaining how to connect everything, and teaching me about the aluminum channels and diffusers for a clean, professional look. His expertise gave me the confidence I needed to take on the project myself.I ended up purchasing everything that day, and over the next few days, I worked on installing the lights. The result? My bookshelves look amazing! The LED lights perfectly highlight my collectibles and books, and I’ve already received countless compliments on how great it looks.

I placed my order, and then received a call from the shop stating that all the parts would not work together, But instead of omitting the one part that didn't work. He who will not be named, asked me a ton of questions making me explain my project in excruciating detail and cancelled my original order only to send me a smaller version of what I actually needed and had originally ordered, and omitted that part that was not compatible.My project is underway, but I am much less then happy with the look, because the size of the channel is way smaller then the original size I needed and had ordered originally. And he delayed my project by 1 week. My next project may not come from Solid Apollo. The sales person was nice, but did not sell me what I needed.

Justin,US,"Updated Oct 27, 2023Verified","Would not recommend.  Use a local supplier.  Don't order direct.The LED rope had color spots go out after installation and we had to replace 4 different runs with new rope.  This was factored as a bad install, even though we had no issues in other areas.  We also had a faulty driver that was not credited due to installation error.  The troubleshooting guide we called, said we probably shorted out the driver when installing it, and if we sent it back, they could do a diagnostic to verify.  We didn't waste any more time or money on sending this back, as the seller had already made their decision when talking to them on the phone.  I will always go through a local sales rep in the future to avoid these frustrating issues.UPDATE:  After seeing my review here, Solid Apollo reached out and gave me a full refund on the faulty LED driver and shipping costs. Changed from 2 stars to 3 stars.Date of experience: October 02, 2023",3
