Exactly as the pictures.I did learn (by confused experience) that ""gold"" (in general .... everywhere, every company) is more like the Crayola crayon gold ... kind of what I would describe as brassy or antique; all companies are consistent with one another. This is ""gold"", and the bright shiny yellow-gold is called ""chrome gold"".  Both are beautiful, but it if matters to you ... now you know... and so do I.Date of experience: October 15, 2020",5

Chelsea,US,"Jan 19, 2021Verified","Beautiful Chandelier, Confusion about Silver WireEverything went great with putting the chandelier up and arriving in one piece. The only part that we are lost on still and was not clear in the swag installation instructions is what to do with what I think might be the silver ground wire coming from the top. Weary to cut it off but from trying to interpret the hard wire instructions I think it would be safe to do so. We had some trouble getting the wing to open in the ceiling but that was more an issue of not being familiar with the inner working and thickness of drywall for my apartment building. Amalfi provided all of the hardware required to put it up. Shining brightly and beautiful! Now to just figure out the silver wire :)Date of experience: January 19, 2021",5

Anonymous ,US,"Updated Nov 30, 2020Verified","POOR customer service!!!!POOR customer service!!!!The packaging is horrendous.. uses styrofoam which breaks easily and makes a huge mess PLUS its horrible for the environment. for the prices you pay for items you'd think they would package in better packaging that doesn't make a huge mess. expect to vacuum when unpacking this. It's hard to restore items in original packaging because of that awful styrofoam. customer service is horrible. returns are not free and expect to pay upwards of 40$ to return 3 items. if you opened the plastic they consider the item used and will refuse your return so if you are unsure about an item don't open the plastic to inspect your item or else they won't accept the return. items are made in CHINA not worth the full prices on their website. if you want something wait for their sale don't buy it full price, there's no price adjustments if you miss the sale. they are missing the key aspect of customer service and don't honor anything favorable to the customer. be 100% sure you want to keep the item before buying or lose $$ paying for your returns.Response: I specifically told you I'll never be buying from you again, wherein that statement do you see I was satisfied.Date of experience: November 30, 2020",1

It took me less than 5 minutes to remove them when I took the lamp out of the bo.  Some of them were not really attached to the lamp at all.  The lamp itself seems okay although I have not yet had it installed.  The lamp itself is of a hefty weight and I like the shade.

I ordered the 16 Inch Round Vintage Metal Wedding Cake Stand in Gold on March 13th for my wedding on May 14th. I received a notification email that my order shipped on March 30th. After checking the shipping status and seeing that it was still in the “Label Created” status, I contacted Amalfi Decor’s customer service regarding the status of my order on April 12th. I was told that it was now considered “lost” and that they would not be able to send me another at the time because they were out of stock, however, they had the 14 inch version of the same exact cake stand in stock that they could ship right away and I would receive a $10 refund for the price difference. I agreed, since I could still make that size work with my wedding cake, and received the refund. Now, it is May 6th and I STILL have yet to receive a cake stand from them and they STILL have $57.49 of my money that was remaining towards the 14 inch cake stand. Since it is too close to my wedding, I have already had to order a different cake stand from another company and am trying to receive the remainder of my refund. I have called several times on multiple different days and no one answers. I have also sent multiple emails requesting the refund and have not received a response. I have had to escalate the issue to PayPal to attempt to get my money back since Amalfi Decor does not want to correct this issue.

sylvia fernandez,US,"Jun 14, 2020Verified","Sometimes an apothecary jar can mean much more than just a jar...A few weeks ago, post full-rent, I bought 4 beautiful apothecary jars as the ""crown jewel"" display for our buffet table, just as this COVID19 pandemic nightmare was hitting my town, NYC. We all know what happened here, and that those here, are still fighting to stay alive and keep our loved ones safe. Nothing is ""normal"" any more. What people may not realize, is that at the start of the pandemic, all courrier services (rightly) suspended ""signature required"" deliveries, in order to keep service pros safe.  Needless to say, unsigned packages left unaccountably, are a theives dream!!! We ended up calling customer service @Amalfi decor for SEVERAL replacements, which were repeatedly sent out and stolen.  I can't recall how many replacement shipments the ever patient Maria there sent us, but we FINALLY recieved our GORGEOUS apothecary jars after MANY failed/stolen shipments! I'm glad we tried and tried to get those darn jars!  IT WAS SO WORTH IT!!! I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THE WONDERFUL CUSTOMER CARE there at Amalfi Decor, Maria specifically. I know they lost $$$ inventory while trying to deliver my order.  One thing Amalfi decor HAS GAINED IS A LIFELONG FAN AND CUSTOMER.  In a time of great uncertainty, with so many ""normal"" aspects of life seeming to unravel, and formerly dependable services like parcel delivery, not performing well, it is a true comfort that a company in business this day is willing to go the extra mile, PLUS, for a customer.  For all this, THANK YOU,AMALFI DECOR, FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.  My home feels like a HOME thanks to Maria's effort. It means a lot since we are still in self quarantine!

L. LOPEZ,US,"Updated Feb 7, 2020Verified","Read the return policy BEFORE purchaseThe purchase and shipping was phenomenal.  They didn't waste any time whatsoever fulfilling my order.  Products were received in no time, which was great.  But in the end, I no longer needed them.  What's unfortunate is their return processing.  You essentially are on your own. The information I used, from their website to return my products, turned out not to be the correct address.  So as of right now my products are in the Universe somewhere.  Super unhappy.  Ensure you understand their return policy and hold them accountable for the correct return information.  Shame On Businesses!As an update to this review; once my review was read by the company, they contacted me right away to make all things right, right away.  It didn't workout the way they planned, however, the products were shipped back to them and they did refund our money so all is right in the world.  I just hope they took my feedback and the section on their site showing the incorrect information and updated it so that this doesn't happen again to someone else.
