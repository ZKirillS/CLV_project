Jef from nOt rEALITy cREATORs,US,"Dec 23, 2024Verified","The highs and lows of a good deal.Man Black Friday, screaming deals screaming deals. I got a power distro that's perfect for spot towers, perfect absolutely perfect! I also got a little six channel Elation sc6. I ordered away and all was good so I thought. Well, I had to check and see what was going on with my order. The expensive and large part of it had not arrived with the small inexpensive part of it. Upon checking I was informed that there's a lot of Black Friday deals going on and that they had overlooked it... my deal was a Black Friday deal... But that is irrelevant. They got right on it and I got tracking information the next day! unfortunately it went FedEx... It took about 4 days to get from Las Vegas to Seattle. But once it arrived it was a beautiful baby distro! Her name is Disty.

The description of events will,US,"Sep 12, 2022Verified","Poor Excuses from inquiry to delivery of PurchaseIt is quite interesting as to how a sales rep will treat a customer on the phone. I live in Las Vegas and had been traveling a bit for work as I am a very busy Programmer and Production Electrician. When I made the inquiry, and followed up with a request that the item I purchased to be delivered to the Vegas 4wall/usedlighting.com location, I was told that we couldn't do that because then other hands would have to touch it and that only the purchasing customer could receive the item. Turns out that last part was a lie of a rude saleswoman. She stated that I ""would need to process paperwork and an additional payment for customs"". That was all handled by UPS and I was never charged anything additional. They Only needed my company TIN. This email exchange happened on Aug 8th.When I was sent tracking information. I informed that I needed help getting UPS to hold at an access point for me and the email I received on the 18th ""I am neither the shipper nor the receiver I cannot jump in . What does UPS say about holding for pick up. Once an order hits customs it cannot be changed I will reach out to vendor and see if there is anything they can do""Again, I just do not understand why they sales person was so dedicated to filling a lie and letting a customer have something they paid nearly 10K for just chance that it would not get stolen!I gladly would have paid for any additional handling that the item would have required to be able to pick up at the local shop, but instead I was told off over the phone. Not only that, but when I had asked a week prior to receiving the item for it to be rerouted to an access point. I was told that she tried and had no luck. This causes me to believe that this saleswomen did not even try, nor does she care for return business. I was literally saying prior to this how much I liked 4 wall and would try to bring more shows through if the LD's/Clients I worked for were putting out to bid.Date of experience: August 18, 2022",3

Rodrigo,MX,"Jun 1, 2023Verified","Positive Buying Experience, but Crucial Detail Omittedand overall, it was a positive buying experience. The website offered a wide range of used equipment at competitive prices, and the purchasing process was smooth and hassle-free. However, there was a significant oversight in the product description that left me disappointed.The equipment I purchased did not come with a crucial part mentioned in the description - the ability to upgrade to Hog 4 software. It was not clearly stated that an additional upgrade costing over $400 would be necessary to unlock this feature. This omission was disappointing because it significantly increased the overall cost, making it less worthwhile compared to buying new equipment that already includes the desired features.While the equipment itself was in good condition and worked as expected, the lack of transparency about the upgrade requirement dampened the overall value of the purchase. It would have been helpful if this important detail had been clearly mentioned in the product description or highlighted during the purchasing process.Despite this issue, I appreciate the prompt and efficient customer service provided by UsedLighting.com. They were responsive to my inquiries and helped resolve other concerns I had during the buying process. The shipping was also prompt and the equipment was well-packaged, ensuring its safe arrival.In conclusion, while my experience with UsedLighting.com was generally positive, the lack of mention regarding the required upgrade to Hog 4 software was a significant oversight. This unexpected additional cost made the overall purchase less cost-effective, bringing it closer in price to buying new equipment. I would advise potential buyers to thoroughly review product descriptions and inquire about any potential upgrade costs before making a purchase.Please note that this review reflects my personal experience and opinions, and other customers may have different experiences.Date of experience: May 04, 2023",4
