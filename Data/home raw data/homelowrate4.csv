DAVID BURGER,US,34 minutes ago,"Pain Upon Sitting?  Try Klaudena!The Klaudena seems to be an improvement to the type of pads that wheelchair patients can utilize.

Neil Brecker,US,4 days ago,"Many other companies make same or similar products, buy from them, not Klaudena!What a terrible company to deal with.  Do not do business with them!  I ordered a pillow, works well, but the cover started unraveling after two days of use.  I took photos and emailed to customer support.  Resent the photos a few days later after not getting a response.  I then called customer service.  I spoke with Dana who could not find my emails.  I resent them again while she was on the phone, still not received.  I resent again using another email, still not received.  I checked, all the emails were delivered.  I finally requested another cover and suggested that I would return the damaged cover.  I was told no, their policy is that once the product is removed from the package it is my responsibility.  I then asked to speak with Dana’s supervisor.  I was put on hold then told the supervisor is busy and would call me back at a later time.  When I complained I was cut off.  I am sure I will never hear from the supervisor.  There are many companies who make the same and similar products, buy from them, not Klaudena.  Date of experience: January 09, 2025",1
Kathy Harting,US,Updated 6 days ago,"Had a negative experience with KlaudenaI've had a negative experience with Klaudena. I developed sudden back pain and googled seat cushions. Klaudena came up. They advertised a sale. I ordered 3. As soon as I ordered I realized I needed to first seek medical help and recommendations. I immediately got on the site to return my order. I filled out the form they said u need to fill out. I then followed up with a call and was informed my order was cancelled. But then, I received another email to say it had not been cancelled. I now had to wait to receive it, and then once I did, received two different sets of instructions to return it, and as another customer stated, the return address is Germany. I don't believe I should have to pay for this return. And, they've got you with this business of returning to Germany, when there is also a support address in New York. I feel duped and distrustful of this company. Date of experience: January 01, 2025",2

I got a text a couple of days later stating order would be shipping soon & short summary of order. I ordered 1 cushion; this text stated 4 cushions purchased. I texted back that order was incorrect that I ordered only 1 cushion. No response. I called that number, someone picked up but wouldn't talk, they hung up. I emailed company support to let them know there was an error in order & asked for correction before shipping. Return email was just a company response that they were busy & someone would contact me in 24 hours. That contact didn't happen. I emailed & called business contact number that didn't answer. I actively tried to contact daily assuming arrival was imminent. The tracking on the cushion(s) was unreliable. I couldn't tell what it was doing. Order finally arrived with 4 cushions not just 1. I continued to contact in every way I could find on website. No response, no answer. When I finally got an answer, I explained situation. They directed me to the return policy which placed all return fees on customer & the condition the order had to be in to get a refund. Terrible. I still have 3 extra cushions & they will not provide return postage. Very sketchy company since I've had to research them. I wish I never saw that cushion! Date of experience: December 04, 2024",1

After emailing many times I was told I could get 20 % back for the 3 cushions I didn't want. I called and waited on hold for 12 min. The customer care person told me the same things. I read him reports from other customers on this site who got full refunds. After holding for a few minutes he agreed to refund the 3 cushions that I don't have to send back. The next day I got an email stating that 51.21 is being refunded to me. Joan from customer service called January 7th to listen to my complaints. She apologized for the difficulty I had.

Joshua Lopez,US,"Updated Jan 3, 2025","NO FREE SHIPPING OR RETURNSThey got me with the ""free shipping"" if I buy another pillow cover. So I bought an extra one and they still charged me $9 for shipping. I sent an email asking why and they said that I only get free shipping on the extra pillow case, not with the original pillow. I couldnt believe the bait and switch tactics. So we received our $58 chair pillow for my wife's back and both of the items, that they wouldn't ship for free, got shipped together. So I decided I wanted to return it, it wasn't exactly what we wanted, on top of the extra charges we just wanted to return it before the 30 day return policy. I sent 4 different emails with no response. Finally, I was able to get a hold of someone from customer service and they informed that if I opened the pillow, I couldn't return it.

Raffaella Roviglioni,IT,"Updated Oct 13, 2024","Pillow didn't regain right shape from vaccuum bag - they refunded itI ordered twice from this company, and some products (the seating pillow) were fine both times. But the lumbar support pillow didn't regain its intended shape after days from opening the vacuum bag it came in: the asymmetrical shape made it useless. They sent me a replacement for it, and this second pillow was even worse than the first one: the shape was not regained and it remained flat on one side, even more irregular than the previous one. I asked for a refund at that point, and they would not give me my money back unless I return the pillow *at my own expense*. Given it's a shipment to China, the cost to send it back equals what I paid for the pillow.Really bad customer care, since the refund for a defective item cannot be treated as any other return (because you don't like the item or else). I will never recommend it again.EDIT: the company reached out to me and offered a refund for the item which I received quickly.

Two days later, received 4 seat covers which I didn't need. Seems returns must go to Germany and the shipping costs 2-3 times more than the items are worth. No satisfaction from customer service.

Sharron Sisti,US,"Updated Dec 24, 2024","Didn’t like cushions or return policy but customer service came through in the endUPDATE 12/24/25. After submitting additional information to Klaudena as requested via Trustpilot, we received a phone call from a very nice woman who told us they were going to refund our total purchase price (which they did) and we also did not need to return the cushions. We were very pleased. I think it’s a shame, however, that they can’t just create a fair and easy return policy. I’m sure the cushions work great for many people but if they don’t work for some people, those people shouldn’t be penalized. We ordered the cushions - 1 for each recliner and 1 for my mother’s wheelchair, plus a back rest and extra cover. They all arrived and I unpacked them. My mom found them to be very uncomfortable in both the recliner and wheelchair and felt they were too hard (she’s 89) and I didn’t like the feel of mine in the recliner. I realized there were no return instructions in the shipment so I called the company. At first I was told I couldn’t return them because I had opened them. How else could we know if we liked them? I said I would be contacting the Better Business Bureau and they rep put me on hold then said she would send a return authorization form. That’s when I found out I would have to pay to ship them to Germany. As others have mentioned the cost to ship to Germany is hardly worth it. I’m sorry I got involved with this company. Telling people you have a 30 day return policy and then making it virtually impossible to return is just wrong. Date of experience: December 07, 2024",1

Like others (see negative reviews) I wanted to order one cushion but ""somehow"" my order stated 4 cushions after I paid. I realized that I hadn't ordered four cushions and I called the company IMMEDIATELY.  A very nice female answered my call and promised that that my order for four cushions would be cancelled.  A few hours later I received an email stating that once my order is placed, that I can't cancel.  I chose to try and reverse the procedure through PayPal but apparently that was not a proper channel for redress.  Klaudena told me that I would have to return the products at my expense with a tracking number (expensive as these cushions were heavy) and that there would be an additional restocking fee. Since this same thing has happened to others, there is no doubt that this company scams customers.  I would be most happy to join a class action suit if anyone is interested.Date of experience: April 08, 2024",1

I immediately called and spoke with Ryan who assured me they would correct my order and I’ll be refunded for the extra items I didn’t order. I asked if this same thing had been happening to others and he said yes!  Thirteen hours later I received email that my order had been sent already so there was nothing they can do for me.

My mother bought this pillow hoping for some relief as she has had a bad back almost her whole life due to a diving accident in childhood. Now in her older age she was hoping this pillow would offer some relief while in her wheelchair. She was so excited when it arrived and couldn't wait to try it. She let it regain its shape from the packaging after 48 hours she finally tried it out and after 5 minutes of sitting on it she knew it wasn't what she hoped for. She tried to return it but proved to difficult to figure out so she asked me to figure it out. After sending out an email that never received a response other than an automated one I called the hotline. Well that was a total joke as they told me they would not accept a return since the package was opened. I of course asked to speak to a supervisor after being put on hold for 10 minutes I was told they would call me of course I never received a call back. How could a person possibly know that something is any good without actually trying it.

Judy Dughman,US,"Updated Nov 20, 2024","Buyer Beware! You cannot open this product or you can't return it.I bought two seat cushions from Klaudena, and although they are rather high (thick)\, I found them to be what I needed.  I decided to buy a back pillow for my office chair and after putting it on the chair, I realized it wouldn't work at all.  Klaudena says they except returns, but much to my surprise, they do not allow returns on any opened merchandise!  This back pillow, as well as the seat cushions, came rolled up and sealed in plastic.  So, I ask you, how are you to know if it will work or not if you can't open it to see??  Kllaudena gives no explanation, just repeats their rather vague, unclear policy, which, BTW, they don't fully detail when they say they accept returns.  Try to return it, then they mention it.  After a lot of communication with them, they absolutely refused to allow a return even though the product was NOT used, only opened.  I told them I would write this review so other people would be aware of this policy, to which they recited the policy again!  It became clear to me that obviously they don't care if you like the product, they just want their money!  Now, I'm waiting for it to fall apart in a few months.Update:  After more communication, the company refused to accept the return, but did refund me for the purchase of the back pillow. Unfortunately, I still believe they need to change their policy to allow returns on opened products as long as they are not used.  I repeat, how do you know if it will work if you can't open it?  It's rolled when you receive it, so you have to open it to lay it flat and try it.  Date of experience: October 08, 2024",1

I had to go to my appointment, so I didn't finish my order to do it later. But 30 minutes later I received an email from Kaudena showing the order for 4 cushions and charged me $96.25.  I immediately called them to cancel the order but was told that it was too late to cancel it.  I was upset about it but thought to return them once I received them.  After I received the items in a package with ripped bag, I called to return them. I was informed that they would waive the re-stocking fee, but I was responsible for the shipping cost. He was sending me the return label.  I waited 5 days with no email with the label when I was getting emails of their promotions.  I called again today and finally received the return instruction.then, I found the return address was to Lithuania!  I was exasperated!  The shipping cost to Lithuania will cost more than what I paid for these 4 cushions.  The only thing the rep could do was to apologize.  I think this is their way of making us keep the merchandise!

Hoo Dat -,US,"Updated Dec 15, 2024","ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICEI ordered One cushion and one cover online, declining  all the extra add ons that they try to sell you for a total of $39.98. I went to express pay to complete the order and as soon as I logged into my Pay Pal account to set up payment, it immediately charged my account took it out of my balance, which isn't default and charged me for 4 cushions and 4 covers at a cost of $142.00.It didn't send me back to the company to verify the order, which it always does, i don't know how that happens.I immediately went to PayPal to try to stop the payment, but couldn't find a way to do that, so i filed a claim immediately.Then I called this company, all within an hour of ordering and tried to cancel the order and was told it had already been processed and they couldn't stop it, But they would put in a request to do so.12 hours later i went through the same thing with a different customer service rep, told her the story and she said the same thing. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that they would call me right back, they never did. 8 hours later I got a shipping notification, I was livid!Failure to respond to any of my requests or to cancel the order. I sent three emails telling them what happened, they emailed me and told me to just return the product for a full refund but return postage was at my expense. Take a guess where I had to return the package to, GERMANY!! At a cost of $98.25!! THIS COMPANY IS A COMPLETE JOKE, no customer service and they will steal your money if you are not satisfied. It will take a month to possibly get a refund and it is so expensive and  you are taking a chance at ever getting that refund. I'm 69 years old and have never had a company that has been this lousy to deal with. Avoid ordering from them at all costs. You are going to get screwed if you try to return anything, I'd give them 0 stars, they don't deserve 1.Update to earlier review:It is now December 15th,Joan Torres sent me this nice response to my earlier review saying that she wanted to work this out to my satisfaction. I have received no further communications from this company. I provided my order number, name, email address and phone number as requested. Nothing, zero response, I have talked to three different customer service representatives who have all stated that they would get back to me within 24 to 48 hours. No one has ever called or emailed me. I'm still stuck with four pillows and four covers that have never been opened.My next attempt at satisfaction is disputing the charge with the credit card company. I will do that tomorrow Dec 16th, it's been over a month with zero attempt to fix this  I really hope I can keep as many customers as possible from purchasing from this company.

Elaine Cooper,US,"Updated Jun 11, 2024","Purchase of Seat Cushions from Klaudena Co.I placed an order on May 11, 2024 through PayPal for seat cushions.  Normally, PayPay sends me back to the merchant to review the order and place it.  This didn't happen.  The order was placed immediately with no change to review or cancel it.  I contacted the company by email the same day to cancel the order  The response was that their orders are processed in a state-of-the art warehouse and changes can't be made to an order.  The state-of-the art warehouse did a very bad job of packing and shipping, and I received the box in very poor shape.  I took it to the post office to refuse it, and they delivered it again the next day stating that I had opened it, which I hadn't even though it looked like it.  I contacted Klaudena by email to return the order.  They sent me a Return Authorization, to ship it to Lithuania, and I would have to pay the shipping!  That amounts to almost as much as I was charged for the order, plus dealing with customs.  I have just had back surgery and was unable to take it and mail it, and stand in line at the post office to fill out customs papers.  I contacted them again on May 19 asking if there was a way to return it to the address it was shipped from in the US, but didn't hear from them until May 25.  They again said the only way is to ship it to Lithuania and pay the shipping costs.I looked on line and saw that others have had the same experience.  I even looked up the shipping address in Lithuania and there was a scam alert connected to the address I was given.  I then made a complaint to the Better Business Bureau and saw that others have done that also.June 10, 2024I am updating the above review.  I received a response from a representative of Klaudena.

Anita ,CA,"Updated Jun 6, 2024","SCAM indeed (I order 1, they charged and change order to 4)On June 5th 2024, Klaudena posted below that they have resolved the issue.  This is a lie.  They promised a refund for my inconvenience for many weeks.  They have even emailed a bogus invoice of refund to show a refund was made, which has not been received.  I feel like they want to do better, but they just cannot help themselves with the ongoing scam and deceit.  After many emails, I emailed a response to theirs for the last time.  I gave them 24 hours to actually make good on their word to refund or I would again update my review.  As promised, this is my experience. No refund and NO resolution.  My review below stands. Original review below this line_____________________________________________SCAM indeed.  Order #2y8nlp8.  Too bad as the product is good and really they don't need to do this to move inventory.  Like so many people reviewing here, I ordered ONE pillow and they switched it to 4 pillows and billed for that amount.  Upon noticing this, I called and then backed up in writing.  The company responded in writing this: ""I apologize and understand that you have received excess items on your cart that you wish to modify.  Unfortunately, our warehouse has already sorted everything out and won't be able to make any adjustments at this point. But hey, don't worry! (...insert upsell here).....And just so you know, we've got your back with our 30-day return policy. So, if you're not completely satisfied, returning the items is a breeze.""                                                             Well, 2 submissions on their website and 7 emails over the following weeks later to get the RMA (Return Merchandise Authorisation [notice their spelling error]) and it's crickets on their end.  They have their $ and one can't return without this form.  Nothing further from ""it's a breeze"" could be the truth.  Unless you are prepared to have 4 cushions, I'd say steer clear.  Also, they get away with this as the credit card company needs proof of ordering ""1"" but when company emails you your order, it's already edited to 4, thus you have no proof or recourse and they know it.  This is how they continue to get away with the scam.  Klaudena you could be much better than this but you take the low road instead.  Karma for Klaudena.  Date of experience: May 10, 2024",1

Went immediately to check PayPal to my horror shock $96.25 was charged for 4 just like many others on here. I got on the phone immediately couldn't get a hold of  person so I left 5 voicemail to cancel the entire order. All I got in reply was a we're busy sorry be patient type of generic email back many of them. First off that order was wrong charge me for 4 also they had it set up in PayPal for reoccurring charge WOW canceled it otherwise were going to take 96.25 each month.  After vm's & all the emails etc 5 days later they shipped it anyway. Made huge mistake I filed claim with Capital One I should have went through PayPal.  Now PayPal's told me they can't do anything cuz bank  decided against me & shocked bank simply ignored fact..I Refused Pkg!! Company has an option to leave voicemail what good if they're not listened to. No response from this company at all except 1 reply through PayPal. Did everything right as a consumer, effort I went through to try save me time them time to not even ship it. This BS inability to cancel orders was never relayed to me only found out after getting documents from the bank on how the bank came to their decision Capital One they decided AGAINST me & will be changing Banks!When I got the tracking number by email I immediately sent them a response stating that I was not going to accept the package I was going to refuse the package. To the bank statement made  I clicked a checkbox & agreed to terms and conditions and they don't accept cancellations WHAT total BS orders are canceled every day I've been dealing with online merchants over 20 yrs never heard those words uttered orders are changed and canceled every single minute it's just total BS.  After reading the reviews on here I believe it is a SCAM total scam they set you up! As a consumer I did everything right & immediately to cancel the entire order so it never would ship. As a consumer I have rights!!! who's bought through merchants for over 20 years and never anything like this scam Co. I have been going through it almost 6 months now made my health worse unacceptable. All I know I refused package I don't have their product won't stop until I get my money or some type of resolution. The end. The fact on their website never gave that information to the bank! FACT...it was returned to sender on January 12th and it was scanned by the USPS at 6:32 a.m. company stated I never gave proof WHAT? Their own damn website stated the proof in black and white return to sender! Thank God I got a screenshot! Forwarded it to the bank the bank doesn't care because Klaudena saying they didn't get the package back. Another issue is I came by the ad for the cushions on a pop-up and boy have I learned a valuable lesson .I will never buy again without reading reviews and never ever click on pop-ups I am on SSI major pain I've gone through several surgeries as well as cancer and thought I would try their damn cushion what a nightmare.  Totally believe it's a scam company must be doing  lousy & scam innocent consumers on quantity & get you by saying you checked the box & agreed.  Cost ship heavy items back is exactly why refused package They got order wrong not me. BS no cancellations terms & conditions don't mean SQUAT if they made the mistake on order! After reading reviews on here wow! Truth is it is scam on Qty & on purpose knowing that people can't afford to ship back. Total garbage scam.  Also made false statements to the bank straight up lies. Say they haven't got the package back I filed a missing package claim at USPS waiting to hear. Package shipped UPS surepost but USPS delivered it.  Got proof screenshot from their website wow really! Yes! In black and white return to sender & usps scanned on 1/12 6:32 am ""return to sender"" YES got it off their own website also forwarded it to the bank but bank doesn't care willing to give away my money steal it basically & give it to an online scam merchant knowing  I don't have their product they'll get product back & resell it total garbage Capital One is too will get new bank! Took Capital One from 1/6/24 til 3/15 to receive anything from them which is totally unacceptable I believe there's a legal timeline these things have to be addressed which am in the process of getting that information. After reading the reviews same exact thing happened to other people.  Assumed they duplicated that order but more SURE than ever total scam!! Talked to attorney took some advice but (I won't  stop to all exhausted) now I'm going straight to FTC, BBB consumer affairs agencies file claims.  Date of experience: December 30, 2023",1

David J,AU,"Updated May 2, 2024","Initial issue resolved in a very satisfactory manner.THIS IS AN UPDATE. 3 MAY 2024.The company responded to my complaint. They refunded my credit card IN TOTAL. PLUS they let me keep the entire order. PLUS they sent me a gift as compensation for the issue... a nice Japanese knife. Yes, they initially did the wrong thing, but they took total ownership of the problem and fully compensated me. That is excellent. I will leave my original review below....When placing my order online on their website, I did not notice that the website defaulted to ordering FOUR seat back cushions. I only wanted ONE.As soon as I got the order confirmation I noticed my mistake.I contacted their Customer Support IMMEDIATELY and asked them to only send ONE seat back cushion and refund the difference to my credit card.That contact was made WITHIN MINUTES of me placing my order.THEY REFUSED.Now I have to wait until the four items are delivered to me and THEN return the three cushions that I do not need.That is terrible customer service.BUT IT GETS WORSE!!!Since originally posting this review, I began noticing similar reviews of Trust Pilot and Site Jabber where many many others have had the exact same problem. Some say that they definitely did not order FOUR but received FOUR even though they only ordered ONE. I am now wondering if that also happened to me. I am usually fairly astute and it is unlike me to make such a mistake.However, other reviewers in Australia (as I am) and in the USA are reporting that, although the product was sent from a warehouse in their country, Klaudena insist that the unwanted products are sent to LITHUANIA and the cost of postage is much higher than the cost of the actual product.That sounds like a deliberate SCAM to me. What do you think?BEWARE!!!REVIEW UPDATE 23 April 2024...I am not fooled by the platitudes expressed in Klaudena's reply below.I'm betting that the final ""result"" will be that I am asked to return the 3 extra products THAT I DO NOT NEED to LITHUANIA ... from Australia, even though the products are shipped FROM AUSTRALIA.THAT IS THE SCAM.It costs more to return the products than was charged for the products.PROVE ME WRONG KLAUDENA!Refund my credit card!Date of experience: April 20, 2024",5

Leonid Turczynowicz,AU,"Updated Apr 17, 2024","Prohibitive return policyI ordered 4 Klaudena cushions and covers but found them to be smaller than depicted and not comfortable to use.  I contacted them about a return and was told they would need to be sent back to Lithuania although they came from a NSW address in Australia.  The postage costs are prohibitive and costs more than the price of the cushions/covers.  Raising this with them again I asked whether I could return them to NSW and was told they do not allow return to the distributor.  This means any purchase in Australia would not be returned due to this policy.  This is shameful.  A complaint to ACCC is forthcoming if there is not a suitable response to this matter.Following this review lodgment I was contacted by the Head of Customer care who arranged a refund and apologized for the issues and explained the company was still learning.   I also received a small gift as an apology for the time spent dealing with representatives.  As I was not required to return the item they were donated to a local charity.

I meant to order 1 seat cushion not realizing the default quantity is 4. I realized that only after the order was placed and was unable to cancel the order. I was told to return the other 3 after I received them. I then found out the only return option is to pay shipping to Lithuania. The shipping cost is more than the refund would be for the three seat cushions being returned. I called their customer service and was offered a 70% discount on the unwanted 3. They used very ""creative math"" and I received a $37 refund on the original price of $95. In other words, 1 seat cushion cost me $58 instead of $30. Date of experience: March 25, 2024",2

Despite their 30-day refund policy, I'm not interested in a refund; I simply want the item I originally intended to purchase. It's evident from numerous reviews that I'm not alone in experiencing this issue, leading me to suspect the company of engaging in deceptive practices.

It took me many days to find out if I return it back to Mississauga, at which time I was told yes, but last week am told to return it to Lithuania, which was confusing. When I went to the post office, it was going to cost me $198.00, so I would be out that, plus the order costing $210, i would only get a few dollars back. I got an email today stating that because I sent it back to Mississauga, which cost me $51.06 when I paid $12.00 from Mississauga, I'm now out $210.00 plus $51.06 and I sent the product back to warehouse it was sent from.

You place your order for one item, and they switch it to four of the items and you have no way to change it. On every item you order they change it from one item to four. You have no way to change it. The run around and BS they give you when you tell them you only want one item and that is all you ordered is unbelievable.Date of experience: March 02, 2024",1
Jo,US,"Mar 2, 2024","Update to my 2/5 review This is an update to my 2/5 review.On 2/8 Klaudena emailed that they issued a full refund. We did receive a full refund a few days later (for the unwanted items AND the seat cushion we ordered). On 2/8 I also received a call from a very polite customer service representative. She said they would issue a kitchen knife as an apology. I thanked her but asked her not to send it because we don't need another kitchen knife, and I was concerned I would be charged for it. She assured me I would not be charged for it. I thanked her but said what I really want is for Klaudena to change their order system. Today the knife arrived, which we appreciate, but I was disappointed to see more reviews about unwanted items on customer orders.We appreciate the full refund and the knife and do not feel that any additional communication is needed.

Denise Hollenbach,US,"Updated Mar 8, 2024","I read that they have a high Rating so…I read that they have a high Rating so I went right to the company to purchase the seat cushion.  As I was going through the checkout process, as soon as I put my payment in, the purchase was completed and only after they had my payment info was I made aware that there was an $8.95 shipping cost.  No chance to review the order or actually complete the order.  I immediately contacted them to cancel the order - I do not trust companies that are not above board with their process - and was told that it was too late, the order had already been started - but yet it would take up to 20 days to deliver.  I don't trust companies who operate like this, no matter how good their product is.Update:  Their customer service did get back to me and made things right.  They acknowledged that they are a young company and are working on some things - so hopefully this will help them become a great customer service company!  I appreciate their response.Date of experience: February 16, 2024",2

Traveling so returned to find all of these unwanted items and credit card charges as well. Now return policy requires shipment to Lithuania, not Buffalo NY which is origin for shipping so they know full well that no one is going to pay shipping charges to Vilnius so their scam is complete.

hmb,US,"Feb 23, 2024","Same scam experienced by othersI had the same experience described in other 1 star reviews.  I had no intention of ordering 4 cushions.I was in the process of ordering 1 cushion and 1 cover and before I could review my order and place it, I received an email confirming an order for 4 cushionsand I cover. This is the same issue many have described in their reviews, which unfortunately, I did not read before responding to Klaudena's online ad. Since so many have complained of ordering one item and being charged for four, without authorization, I can only say that this is a scam!  I immediately tried to contact the company (within minutes)  to complain and cancel, and received an automated response that the order could not be modified and I would hear back when they had time to respond. Their automaticresponse cautioned not to repeat attempts to contact them because that would only delay their response.  No response (this happened yesterday, 2/22, only anemail that my order has been shipped, but it may take up to 20 days to arrive.  I have never before had an ordering experience like this!

The cushion was just the right height and very comfortable while sitting most all day.  The second was for my home office and used on a regular chair.

To my surprise the order said 4 cushions/covers and 4 footrests (note I did not order any footrests).  I tried modifying my order right away. No luck. I then tried cancelling my order.  No luck again. By this time 30 minutes of frustration had gone by.  I phoned VISA to stop payment, but the transaction was already put through and waiting authorization.  Too late to stop payment. I am in the process of trying to return the order which was delivered to our group box by Canada Post.  I did not even have the chance to refuse the order and return it to sender.  To make matters worse the order has to be returned to Lithuania. It will cost more to return for refund than the original cost of the order.  BUYER BEWARE!!!Date of experience: January 29, 2024",1

What seemed like a good and very pleasant customer support, Dana, first offered  an extended warranty and something else I never understood to keep the products.   I refused.  She sent the RMA which said return the product to Vilnius, Lithuania.  So I called back asking for a USA return address.  I was given a long story by Noa about why it had to go to Lithuania.

Bad service,AU,"Updated Mar 8, 2024","Think twice before buying. Ensure the right amount is ordered. Difficult for a refund I contacted Klaudena 5 minutes after the wrong amount of cushions were ordered. I only wanted one but it directs the amount to 4 cushions. I continually contacted the department before my order was sent so the order could have been stopped. To be told to be patient by the customer service officer, who was continually trying to sell me something else at a discounted price. My order was sent from Australia (which is where I am from and I should have been able to send it back to ) but it had to  be returned to Luithiana. Costing more in postage than the actual items. This is disgusting and a total rip off. After asking why can’t I send it back to where it was sent from (Australia ) to  be told basically ‘bad luck’… I sent numerous emails to the manager of the customer service team to have this issue resolved and refunded, to get the same response and ‘bad luck’ basically. It was not until this review that something was actually done and I did receive a refund, but it was extremely hard work. I  feel if your customer service manager responded to my emails differently, this could have all been avoided. If the customer service officer who received my first email five minutes after my order, phoned the company here in Australia to stop the order this could have all been avoided also. The cushions were actually sent from Australia and should be returned to the same place, instead of Lithuania. Costing a lot less in postage. This was wrong.. Numerous complaints from people complaining about your system defaulting to 4 cushions instead of one. Needs to be addressed by your company Date of experience: February 12, 2024",1
