David,US,"May 12, 2023","Beware of ""No Refund"" Scam by Online StoresPurchased over $1000 of light fixtures from Online Stores Light Up website.  They were installed in two days.  Some of the fixtures started malfunctioning almost immediately and Online Stores was contacted.  After several weeks all the fixtures were malfunctioning.  During this time I was in contact with Online Stores and wasn't offered a single solution, except that the manufacturer was looking into the problem.  Online Stores inaction shut my jobsite down for three weeks and prevented a retail store from opening.  I eventually had to purchase all new fixtures and replaced them at my own expense under threat of lawsuit from the owner and general contractor.  I directly asked Online Stores in email if they wanted the faulty fixtures returned or I would throw them into the trash, as they were large 2x4 light fixtures and the packaging had been thrown out.  They responded that they would provide a refund.  No mention of returning the fixtures even after I stated they would be thrown out.  They then stated that the fixtures had a manufacturers defect and that they had already received a credit for them from the manufacturer.  Online Stores faulty fixtures were replaced and thrown into a jobsite dumpster. They never refunded anything.  Two months later my Paypal claim was denied because Online Stores told them I was still in possession of the light fixtures that were thrown out.  They are now refusing a refund stating I have to return the light fixtures.  No refund after I asked them if the fixtures needed to be returned.  No refund after they are on record admitting the fixtures were defective.  No refund after they admitted they had received a credit from the manufacturer.Date of experience: February 09, 2023",1
