After exploring your clip art for a bit, you had really accurate representations of our dogs.There were some delays in shipping, but it arrived well in advance of when it was needed. I was informed about the delay, which I appreciated.The product was exactly what I ordered. I'm not sure how you produce them, but the craftsmanship was on point. I am a fairly skilled carpenter, so I recognize good work.Do not take this as negative criticism, but more as product development. One of our dogs has a black coat, with white accents. That clip art kind of got lost in a dark background. Maybe a thin white line around the clip art?

Heard nothing for 5 days. Then I get an email saying they are having logistical issues but here's 20% your next order. I placed these so I would have them for Christmas,  for my loved ones after the recent passing of my Dad. I have sent multiple emails requesting a response regarding whether I will receive them in time...nothing. But I'm getting marketing emails. And no, nothing has gone to spam/junk folders. Not impressed at all. Spent well over $300, but at this point, I would not recommend at all!!The company seems to only respond when left negative reviews.  After my first review, I was told my orders would ship in 2-3 days, that has now come and gone. Nothing has shipped, they, again, do not respond to emails. I will be going to the Better Business Bureau and if I do not get a response by tomorrow (12 days after my orders were placed) I am going to my credit card company to reverse the $400 they charged me. I do not recommend spending your money with this company. Date of experience: November 20, 2024",1
