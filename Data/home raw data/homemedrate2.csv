SAM BALLINGTON,GB,A day ago,"BUYERS BEWARE! Ordered on the 26th December. Stuck in customs since the 2nd Jan. Contacted Synoshi multiple times in which I am told to ‘be patient’, rest-assured it’s normal’ and… ‘you can contact the courier’!! I requested a replacement and yet again met with above so now asked for a refund, also reminding the company it’s their job to contact the delivery company and ensure that their expensive products reach their customers. Buyers beware- expensive product with required upsells- which you probably won’t receive, and you’ll be left with the brunt of awful customer service who want you to do their job for them!

Edward ,GB,"Jan 2, 2025","Far too many ""Hard Sell"" follow-upsLooks like a good product but I haven't got round to using it yet. However, I'm extremely irritated by the constant emails and even phone calls trying to convince.me to buy a wide range of extra utensils. When I purchased the basic model the add suggested it was really good at everything. Now it transpires that I need to spend a very large amount to buy a very wide range of extras which I was completely unaware of. I wouldn't have bought the appliance if I'd realised this in the first place.Date of experience: December 20, 2024",1
Liz,AU,"Updated Dec 24, 2024","Usefull productEase of ordering the product. Short time involved from purchase to delivery. Received well packaged with little likelihood of damage in transit.I used the brush head to clean my shower & it saved my arm from fatigue when using a cloth or standard brush.I also suggest that an extension handle be an accessory for those that find reaching up/down difficult ie. Shower recess base & walls.Date of experience: December 22, 2024",4
Gueorgui Gigov,GB,4 days ago,"I bought two of these on 14/11/2024 and…I bought two of these on 14/11/2024 and received them on 23/11/2024. By 22/12/2024, when I found time to sit down and write an email, one of the brushes had 13 serious cracks in the casing. One is already letting the brush hairs come off. The contact email explained the issue, and I attached photos as proof. Two and a half weeks later (8 working days in the UK around the Christmas and NY holidays) I received an email asking me if I still needed assistance. When I replied with ""Yes"" they asked me to describe the issue and send photos, again. I did. The reply was that the brushes were not covered by warranty and, a quote, ""Depending on use, the brush heads may become damaged over time"". From product receipt to the time my missus noticed the cracks - about 3 weeks. She used the brush head twice. It did its job well though. They offered us a discount on a new brush head. Funny.£35.90 with a permanent discount of 50% on the website. How much discount can you offer for a brush head for 3 weeks, 2 uses? Thank you!Date of experience: December 22, 2024",1

Isa,CA,"Dec 4, 2024","2stars for the bad advertising**2stars for the bad advertising**I bought this product because I thought the bathroom tile brush was interesting. After purchasing the product, I received a call on the same day informing me that my product only included two types of brushes and that if I wanted to clean the bathroom tiles, I would need to buy another brush. I was a bit frustrated. I asked them why it wasn't stated on the website when purchasing that I could choose different types of brushes; it feels a bit like false advertising. So, I finally bought the $25 brush for the bathroom tiles, but I was still somewhat frustrated. The next day, I received a second call offering me an extension for the handle for the same machine. Seriously, it feels like harassment regarding the purchase. Why not include everything or highlight the choices when buying the product so that we know that not everything is included, rather than being harassed by phone? I also told the second person who called me that it was the second time, and she started to argue with me, saying it wasn’t her fault the first time. I said no, I understand it's not you, but your calls are starting to feel harassing. This company does not inspire confidence. I feel like it’s starting to resemble a scam. I'm looking forward to receiving the product to see if it’s of quality, but for now, I have my doubts.Date of experience: December 02, 2024",2

Kai Chow,AU,"Dec 3, 2024","REGRET BUYING Hurts and stresses the wrist, due to the location of its grip and the item's head. Either top grip or gripless would make it easier to apply additional pressure if necessary. Apparently, applying pressure from the side grip makes it harder, and pressure on the wrist. The bigger the brush increases the wrist strain. Good for flat surfaces only, otherwise don't buy. I am a regular cleaner and I won't recommend it. A terrible DESIGN and pretty useless.PS.

Jayden Mudge,NZ,"Dec 1, 2024","Good for scrubbing flat surfaces, nothing elseThe number of use cases for this product is far smaller than the ads suggest. The motor isn't very powerful, so its scrubbing power is only enough to remove gentle layers of dirt. The rigid structure of the device means it's not great at cleaning in corners and crevices, so only really helps on lightly soiled flat services. The soft sponge head is the worst offender, the adhesive disintegrates with use of ""harsh chemicals"", dishwashing detergent is fine, but I can't use my all purpose surface cleaner with it. Even so, I find using a regular sponge by hand faster, easier, and more effective. The main use case I have found for my Synoshi is scrubbing up soap scum with the brush head. Good for in the bath and sink, everything else it's a downgrade from cleaning things manually.Date of experience: December 01, 2024",2
