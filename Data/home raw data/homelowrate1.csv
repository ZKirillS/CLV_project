John Mahoney,GB,"Sep 4, 2024","6 Cool white g4 led capsules orderedâ€¦6 Cool white g4 led capsules ordered and delivered after a short delay.When installed in a fitting with 3 blown capsules the replacements were positively yellow by comparison.I emailed the company who responded quickly with an explanation I found unbelievable (As an LED lamp or fixture operates over time, materials used in its construction can deteriorate and their properties change, which in turn causes the color temperature of the light produced to change.Unfortunately this is a problem that the manufacturers have nor fund a cure for, as yet.) The new capsules were only just fitted so did not have time to deteriorate.I will be returning them and let you know how I get on.Date of experience: September 04, 2024",3

JAMES,US,"Feb 12, 2016Verified","Very fast delivery and a product we could not purchase in stores.We looked everywhere for certain floodlights. We could not find them in stores but found them here at a very reasonable price. Like other reviewers, the shipping cost appeared to be high, but the bulb cost was extremely reasonable. Therefore, putting all the cost factors together, the overall expense was quite good. The delivery was a lot faster than what we expected, which was a pleasant surprise.Date of experience: February 12, 2016",4

Edwin,US,"Feb 25, 2016Verified","Plug-in dimmers don't work with this dimmable T9 LED bulb.Got a couple T9 dimmable LED bulbs for my picture light, to replace the T10 incandescents.  The T9 bulbs are great except for one thing.  There aren't any plug-in type dimmers that work with these bulbs.  Tried a touch pad type Westek dimmer.  No good; flickers at all brightness settings.  Tried a Lutron slide-type ""Credenza"" dimmer; same result.  Both these dimmers claim to work with LED bulbs.  Lutron has an extensive list of ""compatible"" bulbs for their dimmer, but they've apparently never heard of the Bulbrite brand of bulbs.  Bottom line: MAYBE these dimmable T9 bulbs will dim properly if you have a hard-wired wall dimmer switch, but they won't cut it with the available plug-in type dimmers.Date of experience: February 25, 2016",4

Bob,US,"Feb 21, 2016Verified","Customer Service LackingI have done business with this company in the past and had no complaints.  This time, however, one of the bulbs I ordered was broken.  I believe this was a result of the way the bulbs were packed for shipping.  These bulbs come in packages of two and are mounted on cardboard with plastic over the top.  The packages were stacked in a box with nothing in between them; the box had no top; and packing paper was laid on top.  I contacted customer service to suggest that they do a better job packing this type of light bulb, and the response I received was ""seriously?""  This sounded to me as if the representative thought I was lying, and I didn't appreciate that.  As these bulbs cost less than a dollar each, I will give it no further thought.  I was only trying to be helpful in my feedback.Date of experience: February 21, 2016",3

Terry,US,"Mar 7, 2016Verified","wrong itemThis website was my only source of the bulbs that I needed. I decided that the nearly $9 shipping and handling would be worth it if I got the light I needed for my sewing machine which I use for business. However, when my package arrived I found that the wrong bulbs had been shipped. Needless to say I was not happy. For $8.90 shipping one expects to receive what was ordered. I DID have a pleasant experience with my call to customer service. He apologized and immediately said that they would send out the correct bulbs. That is fine, but it means that I will be without light for my machine for another week while the new items are shipped. I would not recommend this site as a source of light bulbs.Date of experience: March 07, 2016",2

Carole,US,"Feb 17, 2016Verified","Quick Service, Excellent SelectionThis company has a huge selection from which to choose.  I found what I needed right away, even though it was an older model specialty bulb.  The ordering process was very simple and delivery was quick.  The only reason that I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 was that all the documents that I was able to access after the sale, for which I paid by credit card, still showed the total due.  For tax purposes, businesses need receipts that show that the invoice was paid by credit card.  There was nothing to show that the bill had been paid.  Minor issue, but an opportunity to provide even better service.  Will definitely use this company again.Date of experience: February 17, 2016",4
