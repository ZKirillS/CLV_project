I promptly put in a change request through their website within 1 hour of purchase and received a response from NZXT that they received my request and is processing it.  I did not hear from customer support until 7 days later, after they shipped the product with the 2 hard-drives, to tell me there is nothing they can do after the product has shipped.  Their customer support is ATROCIOUS.  I haven't even received the computer yet and I'm wishing I went with a different company.

Eli Taurel,US,"Dec 20, 2024","Custom BLD Order I placed a custom build order on November 30th and received it today, so here's a review of my experience.Overall, it was a very positive experience.  The customer service was excellent; the day after placing my order, I requested a change to my AIO cooler from a 280mm to a 360mm, and customer support was able to quickly take up my request. My scheduled shipping date was December 9th, but it shipped on December 13th.  Not a bad delay at all, considering I ordered near Christmas and requested a part change.I was nervous because NZXT uses FedEx for shipping, but my PC arrived on time. Upon receiving the computer, everything was nicely packaged, and I was relieved to find no damage.  After plugging it in, everything worked perfectly. I was happy to find minimal bloatware and that the latest Nvidia driver was pre-installed. The cable management was awesome too which is a plus. I purchased a different NZXT PC a few years ago, and it was an awesome computer. It lasted me years and I bought this one to replace it. I'm happy to see NZXT is still doing good.Date of experience: December 19, 2024",5

Had an issue with a 4 year old Z73 AIO cooler where the pump died and I was getting really high CPU temps. I emailed support and got a same day reply in under 4 hours with someone to help me troubleshoot my issue. After I was sure the AIO was dead I emailed back a few hours later and in under 24 hours from my very first email I was offered a free replacement with no hassle. My support agent was Adriana and all communication was professional and friendly, I was offered any assistance I needed in getting the return together and had constant status updates on when they could see it in the mail, when they received it, and when the replacement was sent out. On top of that because they didn't make the same model of AIO anymore they upgraded me to the current top of the line AIO to match the tier of what I had purchased 4 years ago even though the current one is slightly more expensive. Overall I'm very happy with the speed at which my issue was handled, the friendly communication from support, and the no hassle replacement. I have purchased NZXT AIOs for each PC I have built and if support stays this good I will continue to buy them. Date of experience: December 17, 2024",5

TrustPilot user,GB,"Updated Dec 11, 2024","I had a terrible experience with NZXT's‚Ä¶I had a terrible experience with NZXT's ""Flex"" rental PC program. They blatantly mislead customers by swapping components in pre-built PCs while keeping the same product names, making it impossible to know what you're actually getting. Their marketing is deceptive, using false FPS benchmarks and inflated ""sale"" prices that are anything but a deal.The terms of service are appalling, even asking you to waive rights to death or injury claims‚Äîcompletely unacceptable. This program feels designed to exploit uninformed customers with overpriced, poorly represented products. I can't recommend NZXT Flex to anyone. Stay away!EDIT:NZXT‚Äôs response is utterly disappointing, as I expected. Instead of addressing the serious concerns raised, they‚Äôve merely pointed to a vague ‚Äúupdate‚Äù and provided a link. There‚Äôs no acknowledgment of the issues, no apology, and certainly no effort to restore trust. A CEO video message doesn‚Äôt fix the blatant flaws in their program or the misleading marketing tactics. It feels like they‚Äôre trying to deflect instead of taking genuine responsibility. A proper apology and clear action would have been more appropriate, but instead, they‚Äôve failed to even attempt to make things right.Date of experience: December 02, 2024",1

After this incident, I contacted NZXT customer support and described my case. Customer service contacted me immediately. They asked me to submit a video of my water cooling system and the error. Then everything went very quickly, I received a return slip and I sent the old cooling system back. Luckily I had all my proof of purchase.

Aaron Gentry,US,"Dec 9, 2024","Not flexible customer service.Order number: 584827Order date: 2024-12-03 07:32I want to say that a lot of the recent news about NZXT is a bit troubling. I've seen both the complaints and NZXT's response. I am not here to flame NZXT. I am here to give a fair review of my experience.The ordering process was actually fun and a couple of the pre-sale phone reps were very nice and relatable.  I appreciated those phone calls. Picking out parts was also fun and I like the design, layout and functionality of the website. I was a liottle disappointed by the lack of motherboard options supporting the i9 14900.  But not a huge deal.Here is where I was a little disappointed. I made an order for a custom build totaling approximately $3100.  I bought two ssd drives for my custom build and asked that the smaller of the two be used for windows installation. I received a response after the transaction was complete that basically said they cannot complete that request.  He said that they HAVE TO install it on the faster drive, that they have no other choice. That's odd. I'm not certain there's a huge enough difference between Samsung m.2 drives and Western Digital m.2 drives to make a difference. This is really a ""can't do"" attitude driven policy. This also differs from the pre-sale customer service representative who told me we could install it that way - that's the way everyone installs them. And the person who responded just marked the ticket resolved without me having been able to respond back. It felt like ""sorry - thats too much trouble. Goodbye."" I didn't feel like a valued customer. I almost felt like they put all the happy nice people in pre-sales, and then after that they got my money and not much help after that. Some companies do indeed operate this way. I hope it's not the way NZXT does. I hope this was an isolated incident.This was my first experience with NZXT. Not off to a great start and I don't even have the PC yet. I'm disappointed and after hearing some recent unfortunate news about NZXT and in conjunction to what I heard about my request I'm nervous about this purchase. Having some buyers remorse and not feeling a lot of purchasing confidence for the future.But I hope NZXT will see that this review is fair and not just here to flame and review bomb. I hope they will address this kind of silly policy to not install Windows on the drive of my choice.Date of experience: December 02, 2024",3

Andrew,US,"Updated Dec 24, 2024","Disappointments and HeadachesLet me start off by saying the support was good. On the other hand, the pc has been a disaster and very problematic over the past 3-4 years I've owned the pc. I have owned multiple pcs previous to this current NZXT build, and I have never had a single issue until I purchased this one.To start off, upon receiving the pc, the power cable fit loosely and thus my pc would frequently shut down due to the slipping cable. NZXT sent a replacement cable, and the replacement had the same issue. I purchased a new one from Amazon and tested a cable from a previous pc and both fit perfectly fine. This was weird but no big deal.The next set of issues I was experiencing was blue screens stemming from faulty ram. The ram was replaced by NZXT and solved the blue screens that were due to memory issues. Annoying, but again I thought it was no big deal.Other blue screens persisted and my pc would often times shut down randomly multiple times per day, and even shut down within seconds of being powered on. Was Windows causing the issues? This went on for weeks to months, then seemingly fixed itself. Then the cycle repeated and it continuously happened once again. I was told I had to do a fresh install of Windows, which obviously is not ideal since I would lose all of my files. I tried several things from my own research and eventually one of them seemed to fix the blue screen issue for good (knock on wood). I have no clue what the underlying cause of this issue was to this day.My next issue was my cooler stopped working after about 2 years. This caused frequent overheating and crashing. I had to purchase a new cooler myself to replace it. Coolers should last much longer than that. Without a doubt this damaged the CPU. I had to use the pc for work, so I had no alternative but to use the pc despite it hitting damaging temperatures with no programs running or just stop working. Some days, the pc likes to run very slow just to remind me that it has issues, likely due to the CPU cooler's failure.Currently, my pc likes to freeze every time I play any game. It will completely freeze and require a force shutdown with no pattern as to why. It may be instantly upon launching a game, or 30 minutes later. Without fail, it will freeze. I purchased this pc to play games and I can't even do that anymore. It feels like I  can't do anything without running into an issue, that is the reality of it. I have no clue why this occurs, but I am suspecting the GPU. Another issue separate from playing games is my pc randomly shutting down in general for no apparent reason (albeit this has become more infrequent). I am essentially just using this pc to browse the web at this point.Half the days I've owned this I've experienced an issue. There have been more blue screens with so many different error codes I cannot even begin to count it. I genuinely feel like I was scammed and was given a pc built from a rejected parts bucket. My friends joke that I purchased a lemon. The only non-problematic parts that I can verify is the case, fans, and ssd. I am sure I missed an issue or two. I wish I could have my money back or a replacement at this point, but it's far too late.Update:Order: 202666Tickets: 1958071 / 1717947 / 1664566 / 1024441 / 1474592Date of experience: December 19, 2024",1

Customer Service refused to accept that this might be their error - they accused Amazon of the sale being open box - it wasn't - and when it turned out they did not have a cable bag in stock that fit a C750 they  came back with: oh well, that cable set is on back order - we'll let you know when one comes in - me with a PC build on the table waiting. I then found 39 bad reviews on CA Better Business Bureau so I am posting this warning to would-be customers. Pray everything is right out of the box, or else...UPDATE 1/16/2024 - NZXT has subsequently issued an RMA to replace the whole unit since the cable bag was out-of-stock and I've shipped the problem unit back. This is the kind of support I expected initially. Upon receipt of a replacement unit I will revise this listing up to 4 stars. I'm not inclined to go to 5 with the time and trouble this cost me but on the other hand the company does appear to be coming through now which does deserve credit.

Unknown,US,"Apr 25, 2024","Ordered an NZXT Player 3 PRIME computer‚Ä¶Ordered an NZXT Player 3 PRIME computer from them for about $3,850 with 2 different 1 TB NVMe SSDs. It came with Windows 11 Home activated and the license key is injected into the motherboard to make it easy to auto re-activate should you reinstall Windows on another drive. It seems to work well overall and is a clean build. Their support has been helpful as well.Some notable concerns:1. The GTX 4090 GPU did not have a support bracket to help hold the weight of the GPU; as heavy GPUs are strongly recommended to have. Thus you need to buy one and install it separately. Alternatively, just take the foam it comes with and cut off a chunk to hold up the GPU. The foam doesn't conduct static so it works well.2. Confirm all fans are working in your case. Mine had 1 cable knocked loose during shipping, which I resolved fairly easily in the back of the case. 3. The default/recommended case does not seem very good for airflow. I wish I knew that before buying it. But so far it seems sufficient. 4. (IMPORTANT) Be sure to undervolt your CPU by 0.05% in the motherboard BIOS (see a YT video for how). This will stop your CPU from throttling and getting too hot, while not impacting performance.Specs:CPU: i9-14900KFRAM: 64 GBGPU: 4090NVMe SSDs: 1 TB each, 2 SSDsFans seem inaudible to quiet while running. Only during stress tests could I hear them and even then it was minor. I moved some of my parts from my old PC to my new PC such as my SSD drive and HDD drive. They were pretty straightforward to install. Definitely recommend so far. Date of experience: April 25, 2024",5

Called and spoke with another person and was informed they were not upgrading my component because they had received my missing parts but in turn would pay for next day shipping.

I'm disappointed in my experience with NZXT simply due to the lack of reasonable resolution offered. I purchased a custom built PC (a north of $3,000 PC) and when it arrived it was built in the wrong case. I quickly contacted support and was met with a friendly and seemingly helpful agent that apologized for the mess up and said he would start a support ticket for resolution. Their suggested resolution was to either give me a $70 credit and 3 RGB fans that was supposed to be in the case i ordered OR to return the PC and have me pay a restocking fee. Since this is not the case i wanted, i asked that recieved the credit, 3 fans, and that the other 4 fans in my case be replaced to match (less than a $100 request) and was quickly denied. This PC is for work and without it would be an issue, so sending this PC back and asking them to build me the correct one was much further of an inconvenience. Im writing this truly disappointed that a less than $100 request to mildly accommodate their error was denied on a $3,000 purchase.

Heather Young,US,"Jan 6, 2024","Inaccurate Order Status, Delayed Order, Lack of Communication, and No CompensationMy wife and I ordered PCs on the same day (December 14th). I ordered mine several hours before hers. Mine was a player two with a couple of upgrades. Hers was fully custom. We expected our builds to take some time due to the holiday order volume. However, after not receiving any updates on our order for 2+ weeks, we both reached out and were told there were no delays and it was expected to ship by January 8th.However, her build was expedited as was her shipping at no cost. Her order is now expected to be delivered early. On top of that, she received an $50 amazon gift card from NZXT.I was told last night that my order was delayed and that they are unable to expedite the build of my PC. They also said I would have to pay extra in order to expedite the shipping. At this point, I was ready to pay extra because I was tired of waiting. When I asked how much the cost would be, I received a generic email in response that did not answer my question. I‚Äôve seen several other stories from people saying that once their order was delayed, their shipping was upgraded.This has been an extremely frustrating experience. I get the holiday delay but for there to be a blatant unfair treatment between orders has really ruined my excitement about getting my first PC. I don't think I will be ordering from NZXT in the future after this.My ticket numbers in case NZXT sees this:(1854851)(1860851)And BLD order number:501501Date of experience: January 05, 2024",1

Dylan Michaels,PL,"Updated Aug 5, 2024","Big Build, Big ProblemsI ordered a very expensive build with some major issues. Mainly, dealing with their customer support. My build was an AMD 7900X with 32GB DDR5 and a RTX 4080 TUF. I had originally asked them to ship the card separately because of risk of damage with the GPU being so heavy. They told me their packaging should suffice, and they denied my request and sent it out. As expected, the GPU was dead on arrival. I had to send the card back, they confirmed it was dead and sent me a new one. Fast forward about a year, my motherboard dies. They were pretty helpful, and got me a label printed out for shipped and asked me to send back the full PC. I explained what happened with the GPU and their packaging, and I requested to send the graphics card separately or not at all since the GPU was fine. They denied my request, again, to ship the GPU separately even though the issues was with the motherboard. Even with the immense amount of money this has cost them already, they just don't believe the GPU can be damaged in shipping for some reason. It's been a week, and they haven't even entered my PC into their repair queue yet. With that, they will send the PC back and I might even get a dead GPU again. They should allow the customer the option to ship GPU separately.Update: I should be getting the PC back today 8/5. They said it was as I expected, damaged during shipment and they had to replace the GPU, RAM, and motherboard. CPU also had issues. This was shipped back in their original packaging provided. Hopefully they shipped back to me with better packaging and no damage, will find out later today.Date of experience: July 23, 2024",2

He had to get a couple of other parts so we built the computer and it wouldn't even connect to the monitor.  We had to go to Best Buy to get it diagnosed $200.00 out of pocket for them to tell me the mother board was bad.  Called customer service they were going to replace but I had to send the other one back first.  I sent their customer service an email to just refund.  Since my son didn't want to be down for that long best buy offered to put in a mother board for us.  That my son now wants to keep.  There was no reply on my request but about 15 days later we get a replacement motherboard not a refund.  I called customer service (Phillipines) and they said no to the refund.  I wasn't sure if we were fully communicating so I opened a customer support ticket with my full request.  Still got a NO for the refund request ""since this happed back in April""  well due to shipping time, birthday present and build time it is hard to meet their 30 day refund timeline.  I guess for them to be lenient and take back their unopened product was just too much to ask from a 300M per year company even though it was due to their crappy product that I had to spend an additional 200.00 and even wanted a refund.  So be careful of any timelines and don't expect customer support to go off script or accept any responsibility from their side.  Also I was going to add this review to their site but it is not letting me add on at this time but I will keep trying...NZXT asked about a ticket number.

Of course I took it all apart in order to check whether I had accidently done something wrong, contacted them for an RMA and found out their default position is to imply you are a liar and ask for video and photo proof of the issue. My pc is in pieces so what they expect is for me to rebuild it, then boot it, putting my cpu at risk, whilst filming it until my pc panics again to give me the same error and then dismantle it all again. A warrenty of 2 years is worthless if the condition of that is that you have to prove you are not lying as that is literally what this policy implies since I described the problem, told them what I had done to try to fix it, even suggested it could be trapped air, to which they said no because I'd hear it, I showed them the pc all in pieces to prove it is obviously having an issue of some kind.. what a stupid dumb policy, especially because with my skills, everything they requested I could just fake, including the video, but unfortunetely I am honest...

Rich,US,"Updated Jan 5, 2024","Shipping/Customer Service SystemI‚Äôm seeing a lot of the same reviews, so I will pile on. They advertise a 10-15 day build rate (with shipping upon completion)However, after purchasing they will then email you saying that their advertised timeline is incorrect due to holiday almost IMMEDIATELY. It‚Äôs a tad bit scummy, in my opinion.Then, on estimated day of shipment, the day came and went with no update. After multiple tickets being opened, just for them to immediately close it and attach to a ‚Äúcompleted ticket‚Äù I finally got through their multiple hour wait time on the phone. I was promised an expedited build process+shipping for them failing to adhere to the timeline they set henceforth, just for the shipping day to come and not get either of those promises.While NZXT has amazing products, they easily have the worst customer support system.This is in no way an attack on the wonderful people I spoke to in the phone, but the system they use as a whole.Just awfully bad customer service. I order a product well in advance for Christmas, just for it to not be schedule until almost the new year. If it wasn‚Äôt for the quality of product they pushed out, I‚Äôm sure few people would still conduct business with them on the scale of broken promises they send out.The best part is?

Gary,GB,"Updated Mar 13, 2024","Problematic build from NZXT fully refunded. I purchased an NZXT Player Two Prime (black case version) PC on Sat 24th Feb 2024. The PC was delivered on the 28th Feb 2024.On un-boxing:I had some initial concerns as there were packing materials on the inside of the PC tower.This included a rubbery polystyrene like piece, supporting the case end of the graphics card (possibly treated), a sticker on the AIO CPU Cooler, saying to plug in SATA before use, and a piece of cardboard over the internal fan, facing the Graphics card at the bottom of the case. Also they had forgotten to remove the statically attached film from the inside of the glass panel.On the black version of this NZXT case, the glass is a dark tempered type, making it very difficult to spot those packing materials. I called NZXT (I got through straight away), and I was told to ignore the sticker on the AIO Cooler as it was merely for protection during shipping.I was disappointed with the documentation provided with this PC, as there was no mention of this internal packaging, also all the other paperwork was just generic part assembly, no technical information on the actual components inside.Important Tips:If you buy this PC, please get yourself an anti-static wrist strap and cable that goes to a specialised wall plug (if your local mains supply has an earth).  I luckily already had this equipment costing me about ¬£25. Also remove the outside plastic with the case sealed (not opened), and if there‚Äôs plastic on the inside, take the side panel into another room to remove it, and earth yourself again before going anywhere near the open PC case.This PC‚Äôs Specs as confirmed in the conformation email:CPU: AMD Ryzen‚Ñ¢ 7 5800XGPU: NVIDIA¬Æ GeForce RTX‚Ñ¢ 4070 Ti SuperMemory: 32GB (2 x 16GB) DDR4 3200 MhzStorage: 1TB NVMe M.2 SSDMotherboard: B550Cooler: NZXT Kraken 240 RGBPower: 750W GoldCase: NZXT H5 EliteSoftware: Windows 11 HomeParts verified by MSI Control Center (Software that I installed myself):Gigabyte B550 AORUS ELITE AX V22x 16 GB DDR4-2400, Unknown TEAMGROUP-UD4-3200Graphics: RTX 4070 Ti SUPER 16G VENTUS 2X Series, 16376 MBDrive: NVMe KINGSTON SNV2S1000G, 931.51 GBOn using this PC:It took me sometime to find software, that could tell me what some of the internal components of this PC actually were. (AIDA Extreme was pretty useless, as were most common tools.)I had seen that the MSI logo was printed on the RTX graphics card, so I thought I‚Äôd give MSI‚Äôs Control Center a go. I soon realised that the DDR 4 ram was not running at the proper speed.Both MSI‚Äôs software and Windows 11 reported a ram speed of 2400 Mhz, instead of the 3200 Mhz it was supposed to be running at.Prior to that discovery I had been running some bench tests using Cyberpunk 2077.When I compared this PC‚Äôs results to other 4070 Ti Super Graphics Cards, I noticed this MSI ‚ÄúRTX 4070 Ti SUPER 16G VENTUS 2X Series, 16376 MB"" ran 40 FPS slower than the MSI VENTUS 3X Model (refers to the number of fans) in an online comparison at 1080p.Then I noticed occasional texture issues, like a rippling or shimmer effect in the game, which did not occur on my old PC with an RTX 3060 Ti card installed, or online in any YouTube video. (A percentage of lower frame rates can be caused by using a comparatively weaker CPU, the rest of the poor performance was most likely the RAM not running at full speed.)A very minor niggle was that the ‚ÄúNZXT Kraken 240 RGB‚Äù is actually eject-able under Windows 11 USB, (there‚Äôs an unofficial guide online on how to fix this).Tip: I have a strong feeling this PC would look much better in white after seeing the black version. I found the black versions dark glass negatively impacted on the lighting inside (especially the coolers display), and with no lights on the graphics card or below it, I wasn‚Äôt impressed by it.Conclusion:I sadly had to return this PC for a refund, as I was unwilling to troubleshoot this PC given its price tag. I was sent an email with a pre-paid returns label (I had to print) to use via DPD‚Äôs drop-off service. It took slightly less than a week, after it‚Äôs arrival back with NZXT to be notified of my refund, and nearly a day and a half later it was back in my bank account.Date of experience: February 28, 2024",3

BakeSmash,US,"Updated May 27, 2024","Very Poor ExperienceIt's been almost 3 months, 25 emails, 4 telephone calls, and I'm still waiting for my stick of RAM. The initial call was promising, quick, and painless. However, every subsequent interaction has been frustrating.1. Poor Communication:After the initial call, several confusing emails were exchanged about the status of my RMA. I was unaware that I needed to send the device in first, as this crucial detail was never clearly explained to me. It seemed like basic information that should have been communicated upfront. I have never done an RMA, for anything.2. Lack of Clear Instructions:After I shipped the one faulty stick of RAM, a month later, I discovered they expected 2 sticks. I guess they are grouped in pairs? Again, I had no idea. A simple instruction outlining what items needed to be shipped and the process moving forward would have prevented this misunderstanding.3. Delayed Responses:Each email exchange is taking several days, sometimes even weeks, for a response. This unnecessary delay drags out the entire process. I found myself waiting long gaps between emails just to understand the basic expectations.4. Inconsistent Follow-ups:Despite multiple calls to customer support, I am repeatedly told someone will reach out to me. However, no one does. I called and spoke to customer support three times so far, and each time, I was assured that someone would contact me. This has never happened, neither by phone nor by email.5. Warehouse Delays:After shipping the 2nd stick of RAM, I was informed of warehouse delays (Keep in mind, this is already 2.5 months into the interaction). Weeks have gone by without any updates, further prolonging the already lengthy process.6. Automated Emails:I received aggressive automated emails threatening to close my ticket if I didn't ship the part within a certain timeframe, despite already complying.After three months of waiting and continuous misunderstandings due to the lack of communication and clear expectations, I am over it. I even asked for my equipment back to purchase the new RAM myself. I'm sure it's cliche to say this is ""the worst customer service experience I've ever had.""... but that is all I can say at this point.NZXT: RA240291854Edit: NZXT, your generated response is a nice touch.

Instead of responding with these automated ‚Äúapologies‚Äù, why don‚Äôt you have someone from your team do the right thing and call FedEx!!! RESPONSE TO NZXT: multiple ticket numbers as I kept reaching out for someone to help me. Ticket numbers as follows: 1826629, 1834200, 1834515, 1834813. I begged and pleaded for the staff to help me. This was a gift for my son that I have not seen in 6 months, and he specifically requested this a PC from your site. As a business owner of 27 years, I‚Äôve never hesitated to go above and beyond for my customers. It would‚Äôve taken someone 5 minutes of their time to contact FedEx as I called FedEx several times as well, and they kept telling me the merchant had to call them. The experience with NZXT was very distasteful to say the least and to purposely not want to help your customer is appalling. First and last time buying anything from this site. Super delay in shipping the PC as I placed the order on November 24th. I contacted them a few times and explained that I needed it for Christmas. They shipped it out this morning with regular ground shipping with a delivery date after Christmas! I contacted FedEx and they informed me that the merchant still had time to call them and have the shipping changed. I literally begged these people to call FedEx and change the shipping, even offered to pay for the expedited shipping‚Ä¶.kept getting the same response, ‚Äúunfortunately, the time window has closed‚Äù.

Hybert,US,"Feb 27, 2024","Do NOT trust their pre-built PCsI was looking to build/buy a budget PC that had 3-4 DisplayPort/HDMI ports. I came across NZXT's pre built PCs and they immediately caught my eye. The Player: One is their cheapest option so I looked at that first. The GPU was a Geforce RTX 3050 and the images on their website didn't show the back of the PC so I decided to chat to them live.I started with the chat bot, who told me, ""The GPUs we offer for our pre-built gaming PCs typically have two to three DP (DisplayPort) connectors and usually a single HDMI connector. However, the exact number can vary depending on the specific model of the GPU.""Then, the bot sent me a link to their FAQ the also stated, ""In almost all of the GPUs we offer, they have two to three DP (DisplayPort) connectors and usually a single HDMI connector. Examples of these connectors are shown below.""JUST to be 100% sure, I left them an email asking how many DP/HDMI ports the Player: One PC would have and they said ""The PC usually comes with 3 DisplayPort and 1 HDMI connection on the graphics card. In rare cases, this can also be 2 HDMI and 2 DisplayPort connections, but we can not provide details about that before the PC is built, as the components can change based on our availability.""I was now CERTAIN that I would be getting 3-4 ports on my GPU, at least 2 of them would be DisplayPorts and the rest would be HDMI ports.Lo and behold, the PC I receive has 1 DisplayPort, 1 HDMI port, and 1 DVI port on the GPU. HUH??? After 3 sources told me one thing, I get something completely different???I was quite annoyed and contacted their support to see how this could get resolved. I asked if swapping the GPU for the correct one would be possible and they said no. I then asked for a refund and they said I would not get a full refund, and would have to pay for the assembly, shipping, and windows.So I don't get my money back because you lied to me about what I would be getting? You gave me something I did not buy which is extremely annoying because the ONLY reason I chose NZXT was because the price for the PC with the 4 ports on the GPU I needed was great, but it turned out to be a complete lie.I did not get what I paid for, and I now have to pay for what I don't even get!

So, I get my pc back and the end of January. now here we are 3 months later, and I am having issues with my gpu. talked to a customer service rep and asked to talk to a supervisor and they said one would contact me for the end of the day (lie) this was 05/09/24. the same customer service contacted me and said they would refund my initial shipping cost and I need to send my computer in to be fixed. a supervisor never contacting me, and I didn't ask the rep to talk to one for me. I replied asking for the info to send my stuff back and that I still wanted to talk to a supervisor. I have sense been ghosted and haven't heard anything back. It is blatantly clear this company only care about keeping their profit margines high and if you get send a dog water PC like I did they aren't going to fork over any money to actually fix it, they are just going to switch out the trash parts they used initially with even more garbage parts.My Advice:1. Don't buy a pc from NZXT (correct choice) 2. Buy a pc from NZXT (wrong choice) if you do buy a pc from this company make sure you get the largest warranty they have. Second, download OCCT (stress test/ benchmark program) and I would say run a test weekly to make sure your pc is running how it should be. Consider it like hoping on to your favorite game to do a weekly quest. hopefully this never happens to anyone else but when your pc starts failing test contact their customer support team and send it back to be fixed and if you have to keep doing that until your warranty expires. they clearly would rather spend more money fixing their own mistakes then to actually make a good pc from the start.Date of experience: May 12, 2024",1

UnrealSalty,US,"Dec 12, 2023","NZXT Support ReviewI'm sorry but I have to review NZXT but for it's support.I recently had bought a 5000$ machine off them that came with a faulty GPU, after back and fourth which lasted about 1-2 months by the way, guaranteed 6+ days per email response and on top of that calling them for support directly on their phone line will not do ANYTHING.I had provided my ticket number in another review which was '1802111' and they said they will make it their top priority, I doubt they did anything lol.Apart for a bogus ""We don't work on weekends sorry"" and than proceeding to not respond from a monday to the next monday is just ridiculous.They asked for me to send the faulty GPU itself to them so they can review it in person without sending me a replacement.. I feel like I'm being messed with intentionally, so I'm suppose to not use my computer whilst for now I have had week responses. This would 100% take over 3-4 months just to be able to get my GPU back, can you imagine 3-4 months without a computer you work on. Honestly, NEVER am I buying off NZXT again.I am still waiting on a response, it's been 6 days since I last heard from them.I'm expecting at least half of what I paid for aswell as a GPU replacement.I bought a PC for eventually it crashing several of times, losing some documents and work and so many more issues which has been happening.Complete BOGUS on NZXT side, I do not recommend. If I could rate lower, I would.Date of experience: November 17, 2023",1

Finally got approved for RMA they received the aio last week on Wednesday which I confirmed via tracking but I never got an update as to whether they inspected it and we‚Äôre gonna replace it or fix it. So far every time attempt to actually get a response from NZXT has been overwhelmingly horrendous as they don‚Äôt respond back to support tickets at all and close them rather than respond to them I‚Äôve politely asked for an update as to when the replacement might arrive. I‚Äôve yet to hear a response at all as per usual when trying to contact them, even their listed phone numbers don‚Äôt work off their website and I even called today which is a Monday during the hours they stated to be able to reach them for help. Im pretty disappointed that a company with great performing hardware would be this awful with their customer support service.My last two tickets were 1826794 and 1804790 i finally got through wasnt sure if it was a response from your chat bot or not. From what they said It appears that after days with no response they just barely processed my RMA order during that live conversation and once again i got no email confirming that it is true that its been processed. At this point the lack of communication makes me not want to order from you guys ever again if it‚Äôs gonna be this bad the next time another one of my nzxt products goes bad.

Jason Wilkinson,US,"Updated Dec 11, 2023","NZXT has horrible customer service and‚Ä¶NZXT has horrible customer service and the company does not stand behind its products. Instead, the company couches itself behind ‚Äúproof of purchase‚Äù requirements before providing incomplete and incompetent assistance.I have purchased four different NZXT H1 systems. (Google for a review of the fire hazards associated with the case.) Due to craftsmanship issues the proprietary AIO has failed in two of four systems. While out of warranty, I offered to purchase new AIOs from NZXT, which I had done when a prior AIO failed 2 years ago. My attempts to contact customer service via phone  went unanswered, I attempted email. Those emails were  responded to in an untimely manner with a final ‚Äúresolution‚Äù coming two weeks after my inquiry, informing me that out of warranty products cannot have parts purchased for repair.  Clearly, NZXT is not concentrated on the consumer market or customer service. Good riddance to a a poorly run organization. I will never purchase another NZXT product. I urge you to do the same.UPDATE 12/11/2023: I received an email from Trust Pilot indicating that NZXT was inquiring about my issue and required proof of contact utilizing email and/or reference number. I was informed that if I did not submit my reference number my review would be discarded within 3 days. This appears to be no more than gamesmanship, as any company worth their salt would have access to the database of consumer level emails concerning customer service. In addition, as noted in my primary review, response from NZXT took almost 2 weeks to respond to my email. Why am I provided 3 days? In any regard, My reference number: 1824699. I spoke to CSR Giada. CSR Giada closed my NZXT case at 7:22AM this morning 12/11/2023 shortly before NZXT contacted Trust Pilot. I can send photographs of the NZXT H1 cases should you require proof that they are still in my possession. This level of gamesmanship and disdain for customers should be rechanneled into productively assisting long time purchasers.Date of experience: December 04, 2023",1

Reached out to customer support and was told it was most likely a GPU error. I had to put down money to receive a replacement gpu and was refunded once I sent the old one back. Issues continue after receiving the new GPU. I finally decided to just ship my whole pc to them so they could take a look. They don't even attempt to run a game on the PC which is when the crashing occurred. Instead, they used a benchmark program and said nothing was wrong but decided to replace the GPU again. The same issues occur once again after getting the PC back. Sent the PC back to them for a second time and they actually ran games on my PC this time and said they had no issues but decided to upgrade my GPU anyway. Yet again I had the same crashing issues during my gaming. I asked to replace the whole pc but they said since they found nothing conclusive on their end they could not replace it for me. Waste of almost $5k and a waste of time I spent going back and forth with customer support.

J M,GB,"Updated Oct 5, 2023","Water cooler failed (apparent product design issue)- Resolved now.Revised from 1 to a 3 star, to say that Dakota from Customer service did contact me and finally resolved the situation sending out a replacement AIO, which was gratefully received. Many thanks to them for doing so, hopefully the customer service team on first level contact can be trained so that situations like the one below don't happen to others.------------------Original Review Below----------------My water cooler failed, contacted them for support on it.That was 24 days ago,Juan took a full week to even reply to me at first.Second reply took a further 9 days!? despite me replying to them in 30 minutes each time they wrote with instruction or asking any question.By this time, I had to buy and install a new cooler obviously.Then after another 5 day wait, I get told the person i am talking to cannot actually help, so I get shunted to another person.Eric, who now wants me to do everything the first guy already had me do, but this time, I had to video it over-stressing the CPU and mobo until it caused a thermal shutdown or they wouldn't help.What exactly would this prove? I could just video the cooler not fitted in properly?I already had the new cooler I spent ¬£100 on carefully pasted and installed, and was not about to overtemp my main workstation again.The pump has clearly failed.I was happy to pay to send the cooler back on an RMA so they could verify it had failed before replacement.Eric's response was that without a video, they wouldn't accept it and that was all he could do.Asked if i should just throw it away then as I cannot risk my computer, Eric just stopped responding.Date of experience: September 19, 2023",3
T. Marie K.,US,"Sep 15, 2023","This company and their staff are useless and they sell crap products!!After extensive research on various gaming PC vendors, I ultimately opted for NZXT due to their appealing website and apparent expertise in the field. However, this decision proved to be a regrettable one. Despite paying $1800 and patiently awaiting the system's arrival for two weeks (in contrast to the advertised 5 business days), I encountered issues from the outset.My attempts to address these problems by submitting multiple support tickets went unanswered. Frustrated by the lack of communication, I decided to seek local assistance, incurring an additional cost of $100. It was during this assessment that I discovered the RAM installed in the system was faulty and non-functional, rendering the computer unusable.After yet another ticket submission, I received a response a week and a half later, acknowledging the RAM issue. To my dismay, I was informed that a replacement would only be sent once I returned the defective RAM. Consequently, I had to purchase new RAM from elsewhere, incurring an additional expense of $200 just to make the computer operational.My numerous attempts to contact NZXT's customer support team over the phone yielded no results. It became increasingly apparent that the company was indifferent to the fact that I had invested over $1800 only to be left with a non-functional device.Finally, after a two-month ordeal, NZXT agreed to send a replacement RAM module. However, they remained resolute in their refusal to reimburse me for the time and money wasted on fixing their poorly constructed system without their assistance. Frustrated by this lack of accountability, I had no choice but to initiate a chargeback.This experience has left me with the impression that NZXT provided a hastily assembled and inadequately tested system. Their indifference to my predicament, coupled with the prolonged resolution process, has been immensely disappointing.Date of experience: July 20, 2023",1

Mo,GB,"Sep 11, 2023","Gorgeous products, great Customer serviceI‚Äôve loved NZXT products since purchasing my first PC, built inside the S340 Elite. I recently upgraded my PC and going once again with NZXT getting a H7 elite RGB, and a kraken elite 360 RGB. Both amazing products, but I had a major issue with the AIO.One of the fans had either loose or broken bearings, which created an incredibly loud unbearable noise, in an otherwise silent PC, just days after installation. After talking with support and showing evidence of the issue, I was sent a replacement fan ASAP.It did take a bit of time but NZXT support were great and timely, and I‚Äôm confident would help resolve any issue quickly. Overall they make really good products, and I have confidence in most of their lineup, but a slight dip in quality for the fans.Date of experience: September 11, 2023",4

Zayne Smith,US,"Sep 8, 2023","NZXT Customer Service experienceNZXT Customer Service experienceI purchased a prebuilt computer from these guys just over a year ago. Well I tried to turn it on about three weeks ago and it wouldn‚Äôt turn on. I called NZXT and they weren‚Äôt able to help diagnose the problem over the phone I needed to send it in to them to be looked at. Luckily I have a two year warranty so everything is great so far. The guy in the phone told me they would email me a shipping label and packing instructions to send the pc back for RMA. Well the label they sent me was a ‚Äútest/sample‚Äù and fedex wouldn‚Äôt ship the pc. It took these guys over 48 hours to just get me a shipping label that works. I send the pc off and three or four days late I get an email from their RMA department asking me where my computer is. I had received an email from fedex the day prior showing the pc had been delivered.  I immediately call NZXT and am told they have no record of the pc being shipped. Well that‚Äôs because the incompetent employees overwatch there are trying to track a test/sample label they sent me instead of scrolling through the email chain and finding the correct label. When I call they can‚Äôt confirm they have my pc and at this point I have no idea where my computer is. They proceed to tell me ‚Äútoo not be concerned that they‚Äôve lost my computer.‚Äù  Luckily they are just incompetent and can‚Äôt track the right label. We get that all figured out and they tell me someone will be in touch to let me know what‚Äôs wrong with my computer, what they‚Äôre going to do to fix it, and when I should have it back. This conversation occurred on August 28th. I email them on the 31st because I‚Äôve noticed they put the wrong address on the shipping label( it has my old address as a return address). Nobody ever responds, of course. Fast forward to today and I haven‚Äôt heard anything from NZXT. I get a text from fedex saying my package is going to be delivered tomorrow?!? Well I go into the tracking and sure enough it‚Äôs my computer. I can tell because it‚Äôs coming from their address. I look at the details and of course they are shipping my computer to the wrong address. I reach out to NZXT and ask for an explanation and they basically say nothing. They tell me what‚Äôs wrong with my computer and when I ask why I was never communicated with and they didn‚Äôt feel the need to respond to my email there was no answer. My computer is supposed to show up tomorrow and I have zero faith it‚Äôs going to be fixed. TLDRBuy your computer from someone else.Date of experience: September 07, 2023",1
