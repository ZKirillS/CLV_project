Ladydeenow,US,"Dec 15, 2024","I have never been happy with Qlink‚Ä¶I have never been happy with Qlink Wireless. I signed up with this company because I was offered unlimited texting and calling. Right now I dont have a phone. Last Saturday morning around 11:30 am my phone crashed again. The phone that I was using I purchased myself because the phone that I was charged for by QLink wireless is trash. The phone has never worked. This was the 2nd phone ordered from them because the 1st phone would not charge. I kept getting errors. On April18th 2024 I contacted QLink wireless about the problem I was having and the gentelman that assisted me on the phone was down right nasty and rude. He accused me of trying to subsribe to another wireless phone company and all I was doing was contacting them to get information so I could keep the same number I have been using because of personal and family business. Presently I am using the phone they sent to me only for texting. The screen on the phone will not scroll up and down. Its hard to text and the volume is so low I have to use speaker phone to talk to my doctor or family members. You can never get these people on the phone, I have been calling for over 2 months and all I get is a recording saying how busy they are. If you leave a message no one will return your calls. This is the worst company I have ever in my life had to deal with. I would really like to subscribe to Assurance wireless again, I never had these kinds of problems with them. Im waiting for the beginning of the year so I can get a regular phone with a plan.Date of experience: April 18, 2024",1

Elizabeth Hardy,US,"Updated Nov 23, 2024","No help!! ü•µI had service with them for 2 yrs. When I get a notice stating thatmy service was going to be disconnected. Because of company members doing illegal things. So they were charged with by the FBI. And to find another provider by a certain date you would no longer have service. Also I was received a text saying if I didn't get a new sim card or the e sim that or my service would no longer work. And my service stopped working & my Daughter has the same service but her phone was still working. Then because I'd applied to another company. My service was cut off but because my Daughter's was working & I'd still not received a sim. I reapplied but even though I was approved my service wouldn't work! So I called customer service witch is a joke. No one wants to do there job & figure out the problem & every person you speak to has another reason why I don't have service. So after a week & a half & having to reapply for the second time. You have to wait hrs sometimes to speak to someone. And sending a message on the app u never get anything fixed. And u have to wait a hour to get someone it's ridiculous!! There is no coverage at all in rural areas & when you live in it. If I could find better coverage!!I'd be done with this mess!!
