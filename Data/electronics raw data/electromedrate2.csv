Sudipa Sarker,GB,"Jul 5, 2024","DO NOT USE IT FOR VODAPHONE UKThis is a money trap. If they cannot unlock your phone, they will give you a credit note to use for other unlocks. This is so funny because if they cannot unlock your phone, would you trust them to unlock another device? They first do a check, which is 26 GBP, to see whether they can unlock a phone or not, and they then charge you again another 25 GBP for unlocking. Then, the unlock is not instantaneous. It will take them days to unlock, and even after many days have gone past, they will not be able to unlock and issue a credit note instead of getting your money back. PLEASE STOP USING THEIR SERVICE.

Now, all these iPhones are essentially useless, locked to a carrier with no available unlocking options.

But, the job was done in the end, so I'm a happy camper.Date of experience: May 11, 2022",4
Jordan Draper,US,"Jan 19, 2022","Service worked as advertisedI had switched over to a new carrier not realizing the device (an iPhone 12) I wanted to use was still sim locked, so I started looking around for ways to unlock it. Looked at several different providers, most rated quite poorly but found CellUnlocker and its great rating. I was still skeptical, but read quite a few reviews and figured what the heck. Submitted my order and then the wait began. I was sure I‚Äôd just flushed $$ down the drain. It took 7 days (5 business days) which was the low end of their communicated Avg Processing Time, but I got the email it was unlocked! Still‚Ä¶ until I actually was able to use my device, I was wary. Followed the instructions they sent on how to finish the process and lo and behold, it worked! Thank you! It‚Äôs a pricey purchase, but in my searching, I didn‚Äôt find another company offering anything cheaper and those all had bad reviews on top of it. Definitely would recommend if you‚Äôre in the market of getting your device unlocked.Date of experience: January 19, 2022",5
LaShay,US,"Nov 9, 2022","Theyre legit & way cheaper than mostThey're legit! I needed to unlock my S20FE bc it was locked to AT&T only & I wanted to use it on Verizon. Their pricing was lower than all the others I found also. They also gave me a 20% off coupon during sign up to use so I paid right at $30 to get my phone unlocked. I bought my code late Saturday night around 10pm & I received it Sunday around 5pm. Alot of the services u have to download stuff & hook ur phone up to get it unlocked but at celllocker.net it's way easier & u just enter the code they email u & it's unlocked instantly. I wasn't sure my order went thru so I emailed them & they responded back fairly quickly & they even try to follow up afterwards to make sure u got it unlocked. I also received another coupon via email towards my next purchase. IF UR SKEPTICAL LIKE I WAS AT FIRST JUST TRY IT U WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!! do not confuse this company w cellphoneunlocker.

Rob ,GB,"Updated Sep 5, 2021","Questionable 24/7 customer support. Software potentially malicious04/09/2021:Didn't receive order in estimated time scales so I thought I would contact their 24/7 support team. Turns out they interpret 24/7 as a phone line only open 6-22 Mon-Fri and an email address they take up to two days to respond. If I had known that the order would not have been within their timescales (currently not yet fulfilled) and their customer service was not 24/7 I would have ordered from elsewhere.Update 05/09/2021:Received link for unlocking software today. This software was detected as containing the known trojan ""Win32/Tnega!ml"" and was blocked by windows defender. I've requested a full refund.Update 05/09/21 2 (Following Cellunlocker.net response):When attempting to use the software I actually received two warnings.The first warning was that it was an unsigned piece program which is understandable as it's a small volume piece of software and the developer may not be able to justify the ~$200/yr cost of a software publisher certificate. This is an understandable decision and was a risk that I would have been willing to accept.The second warning was that a section of the code matched with a known malicious program and Windows Defender automatically quarantined the program. There may well be a legitimate reason for this, however to me this is an unacceptable risk and I would strongly advise anyone not to bypass this level of protection in Windows Defender as it puts their computer (and any data on that computer) at severe risk. Ultimately you may have a different approach to risk however that is my view.I also want to add that I do not believe that cellunlocker.net are acting maliciously, however distributing software (particularly if it is of a third party origin) carries the potential to inadvertently share malicious software and I am not convinced they have taken the steps necessary to ensure it is safe.I've currently asked for a refund in an email sent to both the support and sales email addresses and I will update the review once it is processed.Update 05/09/21 3 (Following Cellunlocker.net response):Final update hopefully! Cellunlocker.net issued the refund immediately after their last update which PayPal have confirmed. As a result I've increased the review from 1 to 2 stars. Whilst the issue has been resolved I believe it is important to keep the review online as I believe the following information would be useful to future customers:1) Whilst I have had quick responses today, I do not believe their typical email response time and call center/online chat opening hours meet the standard I would expect from ""24/7 support available""2) If anyone is purchasing software it is important they understand the risks associated with unsigned software packages. There are ways this can be mitigated such as installing the software in a sandbox or virtual machine so it can be checked for viruses without putting their computer at risk. Obviously this is likely to be beyond the capabilities of a typical customer so they may want to consider alternative options. I imagine most customers are looking for a simple unlock code. In this case the risk is minimal as the worst case is that the code will simply fail to unlock their mobile. However if they are looking for a software unlocking option, it is important they understand and consider the risks above.Note to cellunlocker.net:Please may you ensure you do not include any personally identifiable information (such as my email address) in your public response as you have done so with other customers.Date of experience: September 04, 2021",2

Ed Matulik,US,"Jan 15, 2021","SCAM FRAUD NEVER BUY FROM CELLUNLOCKER.NETWhere should I begin... I will begin with this company is an absolute fraud and scam artists. I paid on November 15th, 2020... they finally sent me a code on December 7, 2020 which DID NOT WORK! It takes them weeks to even get an email reply and that is when you are constantly emailing them about your order status. DO NOT listen to the 5 star reviews on here as you will see they mostly all have only 1 review and that is for this company which they fraudulently post either themselves or have a 3rd party company pay for it. You do NOT get your access code within 24 hours or even some posts say 5 minutes!  You have to beg them for the code and when they say ""its unlocked, no code needed"" I was perplexed. Its a scam and this is warning to everyone not to EVER use them. Like others if I could give 0 stars I would.Date of experience: January 15, 2021",1

Where have I been, when trying to call my carrier to ""unlock"" my device only to be hassled and told:  ""sorry, we're not going to unlock your phone"". OK, Mofo, I got a fix for you! I spend all my money and now you tell me you're not going to unlock my phone? Well, hustle me no more. Cell Unlocker does the job, that the carriers refuse to do. For only a fraction of the cost of paying my carrier a wad of my money, per month... It's cheap. And trust me, some of these shady unlockers charge up to $50.00 per unlock code..not cell unlocker! These guys are the absolute best in the game...hands down! And your unlocked phone remains unlocked even if you factory reset the device...yep!If you're looking for an unlock code - for ANY phone - with ANY provider - at ANY time, choose Cell Unlocker!

I have placed an order with them for unlocking my phone on the 17th of August !!!! Still to this date I haven't received the service nor a refund. Every time I contact them about the refund they tell me to wait for a few more days. WHAT A JOKERS. I don't normally write reviews but enough is enough.Update 10/24.So first of all these clowns are trying to take my review down, then they demand me to update the score which If I could I would change to 0 stars.So I have been in touch with them for 4 times during so called unlocking process. First time I was just asking for an  idea how long it was going to be. Second and third time I was just reminding them that I was still waiting. On the fourth time I had lost all my hopes and demanded them for a refund or Ill go on trustpilot and to my  bank. Guess what, it didn't look like they cared about me. All the times I was in touch with them I got the same answer, ""give us more time, we are working on it"". I must say the magic worked after chatting with them on the last time, the following day email turned up saying that my phone has been unlocked. Happy days you would say. There is just one problem I no longer have the phone, being fed up with these guys I had returned it to the seller so I don't end up with the phone that I cant return and it cant be unlocked.
