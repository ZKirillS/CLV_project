robin dobson,GB,"Dec 22, 2024Verified","The order arrived 1 day early less than‚Ä¶The order arrived 1 day early less than 3 days and well packaged. We already own a larger tablet from Oukitel and find it works very well and is well made. We now have a rugged 8"" tablet which is very good quality for the price paid and works well. Battery life is good and you can hold it in one hand ok as it is well balanced  even though it has a large battery. it looks the part stylish and rugged. I would say by the look and feel of it that it would survive a drop and on examining the charging port/ sim opening that it would definitely be waterproof. I am more than happy with both my Oukitel purchses.Date of experience: December 17, 2024",5

Touch screen completely freezes constantly when you are typing. Camera is good WHEN it decides to focus.  Volume control requires pressing with a ball point pen but the power button is so sensitive it switches off during phone calls because it's right where your fingers hold the phone and just brushing it instantly shuts the phone down, there's no "" are you sure "" prompt. Really classy when you're on an important call. It was worth trying for the money but Nah. Oh, the dual sim slots are bit dodgy too, one of mine kept saying no sim so now I have a single sim phone and this was very early on not after a lot of hours of use. Every time I try and contact Oukitel their default response is to show me ads selling their new phones !??Date of experience: November 20, 2021",1

We purchased a tablet on the Oukitel online store on 6th December 2022. We were told stock was available, we paid EFT, only to be told there was never any stock available, and that we should have 'reserved' the item verbally when placing the order. If any of you have tried to talk to Oukitel, you will know it is almost impossible. They simply don't answer the two phone numbers on their website. Email responses are few and we are given the run-around with excuses. Oukitel has taken our money and to date has not produced what we paid for.

Mark Schultz,US,"Jan 11, 2024","I am very disappointedI am very disappointed. I purchased a Ouikitel WP13 after much research and review.it had much of the facets I thought were good. Although not cheap it was a reasonably high end priced phone. After only about 2yrs the SOUND and speakers have just GONE! No sound, no speakers, no notification sounds, totally silent! No Cellular repair shops can figure it out and remedies on Internet have not worked. I was told I should buy another phone.It is likely the speakers are no good. I am left with little options. I will try to contact Ouikitel but I expect no positive aid, I have been  unsuccessful with past dealings with Chinese based manufacturers and sellers in the past. I strongly recommend that you do not purchase a product from Ouikitel. They advertise themselves to be a rugged darn near unbreakable phone and yet the sound and speakers are kaput after very little time and no incident which could have caused such a major setback. So I now have a silent phone. Well, hearing challenged people have to deal with this everyday, I will, for the time, have to do so too.

I bought the phone from the Oukitel company via AliExpress.  I attempted to contact Oukitel through that medium - they wanted a video of the phone but failed to give adequate instruction how that could happen or how it would help.  The time spent on this meant that a refund though aliExpress was no longer possible,  I have attempted to contact Oukitel on their alleged main phone line - incorrect number.  I have attempted to contact the list of people nominated using WhatsApp - NO RESPONSE,  I have sent emails and attempted to start a chat and have NO RESPONSEThe phone has potential - from my perspective the size and durability I like.

Steve Forbes,US,"Jan 3, 2023","This is an update to my last update.This is an update to my last update.Please, do not purchase ANYTHING made by Oukitel! I have no idea if the company still exists. I have sent messages asking for resolution to two very expensive and very broken phones for almost a year. Not once have I head from them! They only take your money and leave you hanging out to dry. They have no honor at all!From here on, we will not purchase any phone made by a Chinese company UNLESS it is actually backed up by a Japanese company. We used to have two wonderful phones from Kyocera and they worked perfectly. That was until Verizon decided to no longer support them and wanted an insane amount of money for newer models.The lesson learned from this is that there are no HONEST Chinese manufacturers and that one should not purchase any products from them directly. Find an honest vendor in another country and deal with them. Banggood and Oukitel are anything but honest. Yes, Banggood did respond initially but, they dropped out shortly after our problems began. I wrote about that previously. Oukitel has never responded. Therefore, as far as we are concerned, they should be avoided at all costs.

The first time, I purchased a C17 Pro and honestly very scummy business. 2/3 of the ""cameras"" on the device were FAKE and the speaker sounds like garbage. Recently I purchased a C21 Pro and all 3 cameras appear to be real and the company seems to be getting better over time but I find it very sketchy they have lied to customers in the past and used the classic Chinese fake camera scam. Not to mention their email support is non existant, they simply don't reply.Due to this sketchy past experience I cannot fully approve of this company but they seem to be getting better over years but that is no excuse to scam customers to get to the top and hope karma catches up with them.Certain device UI features could be improved to. They don't seem to fully polish things so I tend to run into small/big issues that are literally unfixable since they would require updates from Oukitel that will never happen. They seem to release new devices non stop which is probably a bad sign showing that they just water down their company with never ending devices they won't care for in the future.The company also appears to use ""giveaways"" to milk in more reviews from people who have clearly never purchased anything from them before. If Oukitel is truly a genuine trusting company, I expect them to get it together because we all know nobody will probably ever even read this.Date of experience: November 20, 2021",3

I tried my best to get the rubber back in but gave up think big deal not going swimming with it. This would haunt me when the super charger melted the charge port. It also changed notification and other very important setting on its own.  Airplane mode, sound off, volume down, phone notify off,  Google voice forget it changed everyday.  Got to be real pain when your doing it with 20 apps. I went through whole android switch map. hard reset .. no change. I thought upgrade to ten better then trip to china, but warranty was coming up fast and upgrade difficult. I put it 7 tickets all were ignored last August both before and after warranty expired plus emailed support all ignored. Try again tonight.. took pics sent order number bought both modules..I don't expect them to cover all expense but they could swap it with refurb. or something. Ill pay ship.  They wont even talk to me. I find it hard to believe that web form could be broke that long. Ignore support email as well? I'm sys-admin forget it.  Now I'm stuck with a $800 give or take brick. With torch light and uv sterilize modules useless.  Repair looks daunting and expensive on YouTube. Trip to china, ugh what do I call with?  ill try to call American distributor first.

Since the price was reasonable, I bought the smartphone. Today, December 29th, 2023, my cell phone fell from the couch table onto the floor (carpet). When I picked it up, I noticed that a crack had formed across half of the smartphone. How can that be ? The table is 35.5 cm high and the floor is carpeted. The smartphone is supposedly designed for outdoor use and is equipped with Gorilla Glass. Sorry but I literally feel ripped off... My old smartphone,  Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite without a protective case withstood more and is definitely not an outdoor smartphone. In my opinion this can only happen if there is a huge quality problem within the production of the phone. What can we do about it since i assume it isnt waterproof and dustproof anymore? Attached you will find the pictures i made right after the fall. Yours sincerelyDate of experience: January 23, 2024",1
