Stacy Ransom,US,6 days ago,"Scam - the only way to stop auto-renewing contract is to pay $2k - SCAMDO NOT sign up for this company for ANY reason.

We were told our contract auto-renews and the only way to get out of it is to pay a $2,000 cancellation fee. We sent several emails telling them NOT to auto renew our contract, but in August, they charged us AGAIN, even though the card we have on file expired. Customer service was incredibly rude and refused to help us. Our only course of action is to put a stop payment with our credit card company and if that doesn’t work, we’ll be seeking legal action.

Josh Ferris,US,4 days ago," TrappedI've had a horrible experience with RingCentral. When my business was closing I had to cancel my service. After being a customer for 7 years, they forced me to pay for an additional 10 months that I had on my contract. This is a huge expense for a small business. I can't believe that they would take advantage of their customers by hiding the clause in the small print of the contract. As a busy person, I don't read all the small print. If your company has an legal and/or IT department, perhaps this service would make sense for you. However as a small business owner, I fell into the trap they set. This is not a matter of a customer service failure, this is just the result of RingCentral executing their business plan. I have been trying to close my account, which I was told on two separate occasions would be processed within 24-72 hours. It has now be much longer and I will need to contact them or the BBB to resolve this. RingCentral has had ample opportunity to resolve this. I have agreed to pay out the contract, but still they have not processed it. I will never use RingCentral again.Date of experience: January 09, 2025",1

V L,US,"Nov 18, 2024","o Not Recommend – Poor Service and Unhelpful SupportWe’ve been using RingCentral for 4 years, and while it started off okay, it quickly became frustrating. The setup was complicated but manageable. However, integration with HubSpot has been a constant headache, and the technical support is generic and unhelpful.One major issue is that adding a new line resets your contract, with no flexibility. If you run a small business and need to adjust the number of users, you could end up stuck paying for extra users until the end of your contract.Also, be aware that the SMS TRC registration process can be a huge pain if you don’t have a website and everything set up perfectly. Even with a website, the registration is unnecessarily difficult.We won't be renewing with RingCentral. They’re quick to take your money but slow to resolve billing issues.

Alex Sitavi,US,"Dec 6, 2024","Value and trustOur experience with RingCentral has been nothing short of a nightmare. From hidden fees to poor customer service, this company has demonstrated a complete lack of integrity and professionalism. Here’s a breakdown of the key issues we faced:	1.	Hidden Fees and Abusive ChargesWhat began as a $700/month agreement quickly spiraled out of control. Without any authorization or explanation, our bill increased by 300%. Attempts to get clarity were met with vague responses and no accountability.	2.	Forced Auto-RenewalRingCentral employs a predatory practice of forcing auto-renewals. When we decided not to continue our business with them, we were slapped with an outrageous $9,000 fee. This is not only unethical but feels like extortion.	3.	Poor Customer ServiceTheir customer service is one of the worst we’ve encountered. Every issue we raised was either ignored or met with excuses. Not once did they provide a satisfactory resolution to our concerns.	4.	No Resolution to Billing IssuesWe were left with no choice but to change our credit card information to stop them from making unauthorized charges. Even this drastic measure was necessitated by their inability or unwillingness to address the situation.Conclusion:We cannot recommend RingCentral to anyone. Their hidden fees, abusive billing practices, and unresponsive customer service make them a company to avoid at all costs. For a service that started at $700/month to escalate into a $9,000 fee for leaving—this is not how reputable businesses operate.

I can't believe that they would take advantage of their customers by hiding the clause in the small print of the contract. As a busy person, I don't read all the small print. If your company has an legal and/or IT department, perhaps this service would make sense for you. However as a small business owner, I fell into the trap they set.

It was by far the WORST experience I have ever had with any service provider. Not only did they fail to help me in any meaningful way, but they also had the audacity to try and squeeze more money out of me when I needed their understanding and support the most.Firstly, I called their customer service to inform them of my situation and inquire about terminating my account. They acknowledged that I was under contract and, instead of providing me with any reasonable solutions, offered an absurd flat rate to close my account. It felt like they were taking advantage of my circumstances and trying to profit off my misfortune.To make matters worse, I decided to call back today to see if any progress had been made or if any notes had been left on my account. Unsurprisingly, there were NO NOTES documenting our previous conversation, leaving me right back where I started.As a result, I am now stuck continuing to pay for a service I no longer need for my closed business.

Alex Kuo,US,"Updated Nov 28, 2024","They are the worst telecommunication…change your number without any notificationThey are the worst telecommunication that you can possibly choose if you do not have any other choice. Just this morning, they change my assigned phone number to a different number without any notification. Feel very disrespectful as being a loyal customer to this company. When I called them to find out what the situation was, they told me they can not find anything that relates to the previous assigned number... I think it is time to replace this company with a better one. They charge extra fee for messages and calls and all other features. Their work review process is very very slow and possibly need the help of efficiency department from the new government. Update: After spent hours in the afternoon looking for the assigned account manager, I was able to get a hold of the account manager and he was able to expedite this situation and restore one of the phone number that was originally assigned to me. However, there is another phone number that they did not restore yet and hopefully they can restore within the next 24 hours. Also, I am still waiting on TCR registration review, which I personally think it takes too long to process and they shut off the outbound message function. With that being said, it creates inconvenience to  business operation and customers. Hopefully, they can speed up the review process. Update:Ring Central creates complexity to TCR brand and TCR registration. A simple registration takes weeks and weeks to review and after correction another weeks and weeks of my time. Step 1 is TCR brand, step 2 is TCR registration and it does not allow me to complete step 2 if step 1 is still in reviewing process which I understood. Here is the worst part. Initially, Ring Central asked me to add a website on TCR brand and I did and they took forever to review and later I found out they took off the information that was already on there and they did not help me add the website that I asked for. I feel like I will never get this TCR registration completed. This company definitely needs some help with efficiency on solving issues. Date of experience: November 23, 2024",1

Jonathan Potthast,US,"Updated Nov 13, 2024","GOOD PRODUCT, CAREFUL WITH THE ANNUAL CONTRACTSGOOD PRODUCTUPDATE: After much drama and proving that we legitimately were not aware of the annual contract and its terms, as they were a relic from 2014 when the company was under a different name and ownership, the company changed ownership in 2019. After 3 levels of approval and lots of back-and-forth, RingCentral did the right thing and allowed us to downgrade our contract without early termination fee.  Worth mentioning is that RingCentral's software does work well, our reason for switching to another provider was technical and not due to RingCentral's product being unsatisfactory. BEWARE THE ANNUAL CONTRACTSJust make sure that if you purchase/take over an existing business that has contracts in place with providers such as RingCentral, that you obtain copies of ALL CONTRACTS and have the previous owner fill you in on ALL DETAILS.We recently ported most of our numbers to another carrier and requested to cancel our unused licenses with RingCentral. The billing support team is utterly inflexible and unwilling to work with us, claiming we are locked into a contract that we NEVER signed; and with an absurd cancellation fee built in. This blindsided us and they did not care. They should allow the USER to remove licenses at their own discretion, but it's designed in such a way that users can ONLY add licenses and can NOT remove them, and although it says ""contact support to remove licenses"" but when you DO contact support, they refuse to remove the licenses until the following year (in our case, March 2025). They did help us eventually, once we were able to prove we genuinely were unaware of the annual contract with the previous owner 10 years ago, and we had never signed and thought the service was month-to-month.Date of experience: November 02, 2024",4

Amber,US,"Nov 5, 2024","Bad Business Practices for Automatic Contract RenewalsOur Company signed on with services from RingCentral with high hopes for our phone system as we get a great deal of phone calls during our busy season. The website is unreliable and up until the last few months, when adding a line, there was no option to use existing licenses. The site would push you through the options and you would then be locked into an additional license that would automatically renew. Over the last month, I have reached out to RingCentral multiple times. Each time requesting to speak with a manager, and each time I was met with resistance. In fact, I never actually spoke to a supervisor once. Information was exchanged through a customer service rep that would then submit my concerns via chat to their supervisor and I would have to wait for a response. Despite informing them of their contractual obligations and the legal requirements in both California and Virginia to handle automatically renewing contracts, I was told that to make any changes, we would be responsible for paying the remaining balance of the lines we wished to remove through the end of our contract.Per California state law, businesses providing a service or product subject to automatic renewal, are required to send a notice to the consumer prior to the date of the current contracts end to provide them with the option to terminate the contract. This was never done and when brought up to RingCentral, I was told that they do not send these notices and again I was told to reference the contract. I recommend any individual or company that utilized this company for VoIP services, review the terms of their contract and how the automatic renewal is displayed, to determine if they have the same issues. We will be reaching out to see our options with legal representation and requesting a review for class action options.Date of experience: November 04, 2024",1

I have been having a heck of a time getting any resolutions, or even any replies in many cases, and oftentimes, the replies feel canned like they are just going through a script and not truly looking at the circumstances of my problems. Even if their support was adequate, the product is missing several basic features, such as presence sync between their EX and CX products. Every other contact center solution I have worked with lets other internal employees know when someone in the contact center is on the phone, but not this one! Of course this was not disclosed to me prior to implementation, and I did not think to ask because it feels to me like asking if a car comes with tires.

By the time you've checked the chat again, because it's been open in another window ALL DAY waiting for someone to respond, they're gone.Don't even think about cancelling either. You can't just cancel online. You have to call. But do they answer? Nope. You try to chat. When you finally do get someone, they want to bill you out for the rest of your contract (if you have one) and don't stop billing you until that is paid, regardless of the date of the request of cancellation.

customer,US,"Sep 28, 2024Verified","Nice Software finishes last :(We have been with RingCentral for about 6 months. We have had on going issues. Most of the challenges related to technical support for the Nice product. Although our support team has a great handle on RC, Their Nice product knowledge is lacking. To make things more challenging the support documentation is vague and really does not dive deep. We wanted to allow our users to see Agent lists on shared dashboards. We followed the instructions help article, but it did not work. After 2 days of troubleshooting and going to tier 3 support, we found out the issue was very simple. Agent list is an ACD widget. It can be turned on under ACD access in the admin console. As this is just a feature of the product and it was not broken both the Agents, and the support documentation failed us. We are just disappointed in the service and the support. There have been many other issues, too many to go over. We feel like we were sold the sizzle and not the stake.

The Bridge Clinic,NZ,"Sep 25, 2024","A copy of my BB complaint; unable to cancel serviceA copy of my BB complaint;I am writing to formally file a complaint against RingCentral, Inc. regarding their business practices related to the cancellation of services. My experience, which I believe is shared by many others, raises significant concerns about the ethics and transparency of your operations.I operate a free medical clinic for uninsured patients in our community, relying entirely on volunteers and donations from local medical systems. Our clinic, which serves a vital role in our area, has been a longtime customer of RingCentral for many years. During this time, I have been willing to tolerate increasing fees — from $155 a year to $320 for fax service alone — due to what I believed to be quality service and support.Unfortunately, our experience with RingCentral over the past year has been disheartening. We encountered numerous problems while attempting to add a simple soft phone for a volunteer, which culminated in extensive interactions with your customer service team. I found their communication to be laden with technical jargon that seemed designed to confuse rather than clarify. After receiving inconsistent information regarding the soft phone, we resolved to switch to a different service provider that offers the same fax capabilities at nearly a third of the cost—$128 annually.Now that we have successfully ported our number to the new company, I have been trying for days to cancel our RingCentral account and obtain a refund for the remaining six months of service. My attempts to cancel online were unsuccessful, as the option to do so simply does not exist, despite what is shown on the web site. I also attempted to cancel via chat and through various customer service numbers, only to be repeatedly disconnected and directed back to your website. I spent over 2 hours on ‘hold’ with the chatbot waiting for a representative and over 90 min on hold on the phone.When I finally managed to speak with a customer service representative, my experience was far from satisfactory. After waiting over an hour and being placed on hold again, I was met with a rude operator who misattributed call drops to my actions. This left me feeling frustrated and disheartened, at which time I sadly lost my temper (for which I apologize) especially when my subsequent attempts to reach out for support through chat, Facebook, and ticket submissions yielded no satisfactory results.  I did, however finally receive a response via the chat service, after 15 hours, at which time I was sound asleep!  So, they disconnected since I didn't answer...This morning, I received yet another call from your customer service. After a convoluted discussion filled with vague terms and technical language, I directly inquired about the status of our $160 refund. It was distressing to hear a firm ""no"" in response. This amount represents nearly two months of our operating budget, further exacerbating my disappointment in RingCentral's current ethical standards.Many others appear to share my sentiment, as indicated by the numerous complaints lodged against RingCentral on the Better Business Bureau website. It seems that your company is systematically barring customers from cancelling their accounts and employing deceptive practices to retain funds, even in cases where accounts have been closed.It is disheartening to witness what seems to be a shift from RingCentral's formerly reputable service to practices that could be deemed unethical. I sincerely hope that you will address these issues, not only for the benefit of my clinic but for all your customers who are facing similar challenges.Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.Date of experience: September 24, 2024",1

Vanessa,AU,"Sep 23, 2024","Poor Service. Dodgy contract. Read the fine print, review your contract at least 3 months prior to expiry date or you'll be locked in for an eternity. Our IT company introduced us to RingCentral after we needed to move from a landline phone system to VOIP. With their assistance, it was easy enough to set up, and the YeahLink phones we purchased at the same time, are still operational 5 years later. However the service is extremely lacking, especially if you're outside of your initial 24 month contract, so when we  contacted RingCentral assistance from RingCentral to correct issues caused by an unplanned, unreported update, we were left fixing the issue in all our user profiles and YeahLink hardware ourselves. It was time consuming and infuriating. If we were a much bigger company it would have been a mammoth job. The lack of service lead us to start the process of parting ways with RingCentral and find a new Voip provider, however RingCentral wouldn't respond to our notification that we were parting ways or provide information to facilitate the move, and eventually after multiple calls or emails, they responded advising that we were still in contract for another 12 months, because their contracts renew automatically for 24 months after the expiry date. Now we're stuck in a battle, trying to get out of the contract that shouldn't be legally binding in Australian consumer law, but can't get anyone at RingCentral to respond to us. Do NOT sign with RingCentral or any telco who has a contracted period, and if you do, mark it in your email calendar to review 3 months prior to the expiry date so you can cancel the service in writing 30 days (I'd give 90 days if you can, and then keep contacting them to confirm, because they won't respond). They will make it impossible to cancel your account. Date of experience: September 16, 2024",2

After researching my options I ported my virtual number to MS Teams, saving $550 per year. Ring Central does not enable you to cancel their services without speaking to an agent. I spent nearly three hours on hold trying to reach an agent, only for the agent to try to sell me on four plans and then to inform me that they require a 30 notice to cancel the plan. To be clear, I signed my agreement seven years ago and did not remember this in the fine print - but find it extremely shady that nothing in the admin portal outlining how to cancel an account reminds users that they must notify Ring Central 30 days in advance. It's also interesting that I was able to reach a sales agent in less than 5 minutes, but reaching an agent to cancel took 3 hours of hold time on the phone. Date of experience: September 20, 2024",1
