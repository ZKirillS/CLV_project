Jon,GB,"Dec 14, 2020","I'd avoid Benq monitorsI'd avoid Benq monitors. They are supposed to be photographic media quality but you need equipment to calibrate them that costs more than the monitor. You can do a decent job with the basic monitor controls, but it's not great.

I know there are supposed to be plenty of quick fixes for this problem - which everyone has. But believe me, I've tried them all and they don't work.

The unit I received has a focus uniformity defect where the top of the screen is out of focus when the bottom is in focus. I called BenQ customer support the following week to report the issue and was told to send a video of the issue. I sent the video that same day but received no response. I followed up twice by email with no response before calling the following week. I was told to fill out a form for the return process, which I filled out and emailed that same day. Since then, I have called twice and emailed 3 times and nothing has happened. The fact that customer support has been so unresponsive for a 1200 dollar item is frankly ridiculous.

BUT had I problems with Palette Master with the new one. Support was some help but it still didn’t work and was causing a lot of problems to do what they wanted. Told them I was giving up and going to use another calibration, SpyderXPro. Amazingly they came back and said they were pleased Palette Master was now working and never replied when I pointed out no it wasn’t. Then I found there were a lot of customers who had failed to get the program to work.

Instead of simply telling us how to get our Google Jam board up and running in what should have been a one hour trouble shoot tops... the sales/ technical support staff fell short in more or less all ways and has yet to follow up on if the board is working. Thankfully we figured the problem out without them after the product arrived 4 days late which was followed by 3-4 days of fiddling on our own accord until we figured out the issue we are now over a week behind in production.When they say we'll get back to you tomorrow, they are lying... or they just forgot I'm not sure which of these two possibly answers is correct. but neither is a show of competence or customer concern.  Also, how rude they where along with their lack of willingness to just solve our issue/ issues instead of passing the issue or issues to the next guy is a problem... it's clear they don't have an interest in working with small businesses.

I also noticed significant chromatic aberration around sharp white objects, such as subtitles, contrary to what they claim in the product overview webpage. So I called customer service next day. Very nice customer service. Representative had the patience to here the problem with the product and send an immediate replacement RMA. I'm in the process of getting the replacement copy.

It was beyond the 6 mo. warranty period so I just dealt with it until it came up with a message that it was time to replace the lamp because it had over 7500 hours on it! New lamp they said? I could have left it on 24/7 and it wouldn't have clocked those hours! Not to mention, how much had this thing been used before I purchased it. ""Refurbished"" takes on a whole new meaning. This projector had to have been used for years before I bought it. That's crazy!!! They wouldn't warranty it. They said they put a new lamp in it and that's that. Shady.

AND when you can get a hold of a person their services is typically great.   But the trick is getting these results.  I've owned multiple projectors and every one has had a problem.  The last one, the ht3050 has lasted (the others only 6 months or less) 3 plus years. But unlike most projectors the bulb never goes dim and poor picture.  Nope. It blows up.  Every.  Single. Time.  Then when you try to get a hold of BenQ support they don't answer.  I've sent 3 emails and have been on hold for over an hour and 20 minutes. No answers and their answering service hangs up on you.    Again I love the products when they work and actually want to try their ht3550 (it had a different bulb and looks awesome) but I can't even get their sales people to answer the dang phone.

At first I didnt think there was a big difference in what brand or screen I bought, but after researching BenQ came up and I decided in giving them a shot. I got the BenQ XL2411 model and I absolutely love it. The ease of customization of making sure the picture colors and quality are exactly to my preference was an exciting experience because using other monitors it's just ""standard/movie/etc"" but with this monitor it has ""FPS1/FPS2/GAMER1/etc"" and if the prebuilt settings aren't to your liking, you can tweak them and save them as your own personalized setting. All of these features, the ease of accessing the features, and the overall quality of the monitor blew me away. I highly recommend this screen to anyone debating on what screen to buy; if you can afford it. But honestly your monitor is what you will be staring at the entire time while using your pc, might as well make it an experience worth looking at! I also opted for the 24"" instead of the 27"" due to convenience of size. And the 24"" by no means a small screen.Date of experience: July 18, 2018",5

Subhankar Barai,US,"Updated Aug 20, 2018Verified","Not so great RMA process and quality controlI received the first monitor as a broken one. It was surprising for me specially because it looked like the break was not from the shipment handling as the box and the package looked okay. The monitor frame had a dent OUTWARD as if someone had inserted a screw driver on one side and bent the frame outward. A hit on the box from outside cannot do such a bend on the monitor frame.  The monitor glass could not be understood as broken, until I powered it on.I called helpdesk and an RMA email was sent to me after 4 days of calling. This was a delay I did not like and was almost going to call again when I saw the RMA email come in. THE RMA process is also not as streamlined as others as you have to provide serial number, product number and other info and send a filled up form before you can get an RMA number or a shipping label. My experience with others have been to call and provide just the order number. So it is a two step process and took a solid 4-5 days before I could get a shipping label. My deduction of two star is because of the above mentioned facts.However, once I sent back the monitor, a second shipment was sent on the same day they received the monitor back. The customer service person was cooperative/polite in the discussions.So the 3 stars.Hopefully this feedback is taken in a constructive manner to improve the process.Did I mention that the second monitor is as good as new? And it works fantastic.Date of experience: August 06, 2018",3
Danielle,US,"Jan 24, 2019","I wish I could give this place 0 starsI wish I could give this place 0 stars.  This was one of the worst companies I have ever dealt with.  So on 12/8 I ordered a monitor for my son for Christmas.  It said it was ship in 2-3 days.  Over a week later I saw it had not shipped yet and called the company.  They informed me that it was on backorder until mid January.  I received no notification of this, no email or anything.  I was basically told ""a lot of people were affected by this I don't know what to tell you"".  So Christmas came and my son was disappointed as you would expect because this was the only thing he really wanted.  He found the monitor somewhere else and wanted to cancel with this company.  I called in on 12/27 to cancel, was told I would get a refund in a week.  A week passes, I get an email that the monitor shipped.  I called and asked what was going on.  I got another well it shipped and there is nothing we can do about it so you will just have to send it back when it arrives.  So monitor comes, I ship it back, expecting a refund to come.  Nope, still sitting here today 1/24 with no refund.  I have called to ask what is going on and been hung up on, yelled at, talked over, and no answer to when I am going to get my refund.

Miss PW,GB,"Feb 16, 2021","Awful! Still awaiting my refund on a faulty monitor!ZERO STARS! I ordered a PD2700U monitor (costing over £400) directly from the BenQ website on the 8th Jan, it arrived swiftly on the 13th January. The moment I opened it, noticed it was faulty and immediately contacted BenQ customer service to report this, with photos and videos. BenQ customer service said to send further images of it switched on, I really didn't want to get it out of all of its packaging if I needed to return it but followed their advise. They advised they would organise for an exchange at my door and someone would contact me between 2 to 5 working days. I heard nothing. Contacted BenQ about their silence, they blamed Brexit for the delay yet they were able to send me a monitor from the Netherlands by the 13th January (within a week after I ordered it). Gave them a chance and waited a further week for the exchange. Radio silence yet again. This time requested a refund as I am losing business and valuable time on projects without a monitor. They apologised for the delay and suggested I request the refund from their website under my order details. I did this and UPS picked up my monitor. My monitor didn't move from Tamworth UPS centre for over a week so I contacted them. They advised my monitor had been deemed lost so I needed to raise a claim to investigate. Their claims form on the website wouldn't accept my details. rang UPS back, they said I can't raise the claim due to BenQ being the contracting company so they have to do it. I contacted BenQ and told them the info UPS had given me and that I wanted my refund asap! BenQ then said to leave it with them they would deal with it and process my refund immediately. That was 2 weeks ago now! Last week on Monday my original monitor was delivered back to me by UPS stating that due to Brexit, European boarders will not accept the return back into the country without an ""internal invoice"". I contacted BenQ straight away to inform them, They organised an RMA to a UK partner company to accept the return on their behalf, I was still meant to have received my refund by now, still nothing. The partner company Equinox arranged a very quick pickup of my monitor via DHL, it was picked up 2 days after it arrived back to my property. Chased my refund 6 days ago. BenQ's customer care said unable to process refund as they need an IBAN and Swift details. Contacted my bank to get these from them (but this wasn't originally needed in order to buy the damn thing in the first place). Sent them over the same day... no update on my refund at all. There doesn't seem to be a complaints department or senior management to deal directly with. The stress this has caused me is unreal. I am still awaiting my refund of over £400 with BenQ unable to advise me on what the hold up is! RIDICULOUS!Date of experience: February 16, 2021",1

I thought great thank you I was so excited as I'm semidisabled with mental health problems and dealing this sort of thing can be a real struggle for me..The exchange arrived in a tiny box it had been completely taken apart, it had no bolts, not covers to hide bolts, no PSU, it was really dirty like muddy dirty and the screen was smashed so bad it could never have happened on one delivery.. Even the DHL diver was shocked he told me to refuse the delivery on the grounds it's not been boxed right and was clearly E WASTE and not a referbishesd monitor I was promised by benQ!! I'm left shaking because it was a one off warranty so they can just say we tried sorry but I can't afford to spend £700 on a monitor that breaks down twice in under 2years, I wish you upload pictures because this monitor was out of a top for sure and there's is no hiding that fact.. I informed benQ of my disabilities and they where really understanding and my monitor has just sat on my desk it's in immaculate condition Vs this dogs dinner they tried to exchange it for really really disappointed, the delivery driver was really really nice though and broke DHL rules to let me open the box because he could tell something was badly wrong and that I needed help.. What was really annoying was benQ insisted I found an appropriate box to the point I had to spend £30 buying a huge box + packing for a monitor this size and then they send out this broken junk in a box 10x to small with no packing it's really really shocking still can't get over it left me shaken..Date of experience: September 27, 2022",1

When it arrived there were utterly no instructions, not even on how to assemble it.  There was no software.  I had to download instructions, the manual and the calibration software from their web site. So I got it set up and calibrated it using their own software.  It looked really bad.  Their software has an evaluation piece so I ran that too and it confirmed the obvious, the average DeltaE was over 6.  Terrible.  I went through the process again with the same results.

Dennis,US,"Jun 7, 2018Verified","I purchased a refurbished PD2710QCI purchased a refurbished PD2710QC. When it arrived, the right corner of the display was cracked, I hoped that it was just a one-time shipping issue. BenQ quickly processed a replacement. However, the 2nd time around a left corner of the display was cracked. This time I wasn't sure what to think, but I e-mailed to let BenQ know. Sean from BenQ gave me a call and explained this has happened in the past, and it seems that both display cracks could have been caused while shipping via Fedex. He helped me process an advanced replacement and finally I have a non-cracked display to use! I am happy with the service although it took quite some time to process. My recommendation is to wrap refurb models more securely, especially monitor corners. Another option is to mark item as fragile while shipping.Date of experience: June 07, 2018",4

Anthony Ward,US,"Jun 5, 2018Verified","Worst buying experience of my lifeI am 69 years old, and this was by far the worst buying experience in my life !On May 11, I ordered a refurb HT2050 projector. The return verification Email said that the projector would ship in approximately 2 days. By May 17, I had not received any correspondence from BenQ, so I called and spoke to Tim. Tim told me that the order was on some sort of fraud hold, but could not give me any specific details, but would find out and let me know. He also told me that my credit card had not been charged, as they do not charge your account until the order is shipped.On May 18, I had not heard anything back, and called again. Tim became quite aggravated with me and told me again that my account had not been charged and I could just cancel the order. I told him I did not want to cancel, I just wanted them to ship the projector. Tim then hung up on me. I then contacted my credit card company, and was told the yes, BenQ had charged my account the same day the original order had been placed.I called back and spoke to Tim again, told him that contrary to what he had told me, my account had been charged my account had been charged. He then asked me why don't I just buy it somewhere else and proceeded to hang up on me again.I then called back and spoke to Andy, who was quite courteous. He explained that the shipping address was erroneous , and that was why the order was not shipped. It turned out that the zip code had two numbers transposed. By this time I was wondering if BenQ was just going to keep my money, never ship, and never contact me. Andy then cancelled my first order, and I ordered again, this time with the correct address. The projector arrived about three days later.It is now June 5, and my credit card has still not been credited for the first order. I called BenQ, spent over an hour on hold, and was not able to speak to anyone. I guess that I will have to protest the charges with Visa since BenQ seems to have no respect for their customers.Date of experience: June 05, 2018",1

Robert Muller,US,"May 26, 2018Verified","This is my first projectorThis is my first projector, so i wasn't sure I wanted to go all in spending a lot of money.  I saw the review for this unit on Secrets of Home Theater, and decided to make the plunge.  For less than a new TV, I'm getting a 100"" screen and a fabulous movie theater like experience.  I'm not sure how much better it would be if I had gotten a 4k or 4k pixel shifted unit with hdr, but I know I would have spent much more.  My only regret is that i didn't do this sooner.  I think I ended up being more worried about my screen choice than the choice for this projector.  Very flexible positioning for being just 9 ft to get a hundred inches, or longer through for the same. This projector is awesome!  Highly recommend!Date of experience: May 26, 2018",5

Joe M.,US,"May 21, 2018Verified","Honestly a Hassle free experience that's worth while.I was recommended to go buy a gaming monitor on BenQ by a friend. He told me what he recommended so I checked it out, immediately went to the website because I'd found what I'd been looking for on Amazon. Found it to be a few $$$ less and thought okay, its cheaper here. But I also noticed that there was a coupon to save 25% on refurbished products and thought I'd check to see if the same monitor was on here refurbished and to my luck it was. So I got the same monitor that was $250 on Amazon brand new, refurbished for $170. I got the BenQ ZOWIE 24"" XL2411 PC eSports Gaming Monitor, and I've been using it for over a month now and I'm super happy with my purchase, so yea I'd recommend BenQ, also I was able to pay with my Amazon Account which was pretty cool so it just made it easier.Date of experience: May 21, 2018",5

So no shipment, no product, no notification of this, but BenQ still charged my bank account...I got in touch with a customer service rep named Tim who really helped me out. He made sure my next purchase was in stock, verified, and then shipped.  He also made sure my previous order was closed and that I got a full refund and 15% off my next purchase.
