Connor,GB,6 days ago,"I've had 10+ years of useful tools from themI've used IObit programs for going on ten years now.The uninstaller, smart ram, system care, driver booster, etc etcAll of their tools have proven massively useful to me.The uninstaller especially as I just adore how brutal and merciless it is in uninstalling whatever the thing is. Perfect for uninstalling MS Edge browser which starts in the background (as can be seen in the task manager) and doesnt allow you to uninstall it by default. It even goes digging into the registry and straight up moIests the program you were uninstalling by removing all traces of it. I just love that part. The only reason I'm dropping a star is the annoying as fk popups, and the dodgy installation process where they set the ""cancel"" button to continue instead of cancel. Essentially trying to trip you up if you dont want to install other programs like their VPN during installation, or if you're trying to uninstall one of the programs. IObit, remove that annoying ass design and I'll give you 5 stars. Date of experience: January 07, 2025",4

RnR,US,"Dec 24, 2024","iObit Driver Booster (v12)iObit Driver Booster (v12)If you have a manufacturer-provided driver tool, such as those from Lenovo or HP, it's generally best to stick with that. However, if you find yourself needing to fix problematic drivers, I suggest trying the free version of iObit Driver Booster.Before using it to resolve a vulnerability in the drivers of my Microsoft Surface Pro, I read many reviews. Ironically, Microsoft hadn't properly managed or updated these drivers. While Driver Booster offers a lot of optional (almost spam-like) features, as long as you carefully read through and only install what you need, you should be fine. I ran the software and its contents through several security programs like #Crowdstrike, and I didn't encounter any issues.Date of experience: December 12, 2024",4

John Grace,US,"Dec 7, 2024","IObit is not goodFirst, all these 5 star reviews read like they are being written by IObit employees.  There are obvious cues if you know how to look for it.  If that is happening, that should tell you something.Advanced System Care started out as pretty nice software package.  They have slowly divided the individual software programs into separate packages so you now have to buy 4-5 different bundles.  So costs have gone way up over the years.  However, it RELENTLESSLY, has pop-ups come up on your screen trying to get you to buy more of their products.  I am talking about multiple times a day.  And there is no way to turn it off except to completely uninstall this software.  I sent multiple messages to IObit which they just ignore.  This last part is pure speculation on my part.  The underlining feeling for the company I have is that they are kinda slimy.  I could never get in contact with anyone.  And just everything I read from other posts.  But that is really just my feeling and should be taking with some measure of caution.  Date of experience: January 31, 2024",1

However, I started to notice that is began installing additional software packages in the background that I then had to uninstall.

Noticed that my sound was disabled as the mic was running, their screen recorder app, which it installed, was running, recording sounds - it was trying to run the camera but I use an external which was not plugged in - internal disabled.

John Kane,GB,"Updated Sep 20, 2024","£78.46 was taken from my bank account by Iobit without my knowledge.  £78.was taken from my bank by Iobit. On contacting them I was told they had refunded the money back into my account.It turned out they are refunding me  57.68 EUR. The  57.68 EUR is £48.62.This means they are not returning the full amount of £78.46, and are keeping £29.84 without any explanation. I have asked them a few times why the money was taken out in the first place, but I never get an answer. I would say to anyone dealing with this company, you are taking a big chance giving them your bank details. As a pensioner I can't afford some large company dipping into my bank account to take what they want. I also asked them to remove my bank details from their records, but never received a reply to this.Their software is all fancy bells and bangles on screen making you think the software is doing something, but it is actually leaving coding behind deep within your system. Even after uninstalling the software my machine is full of unwanted files that can damage your system. AVOID THIS COMPANY OR USE IT AT YOUR PERIL THEIR SUPPORT FEELS LIKE YOUR DEALING WITH A SCAM CENTRE.  UPDATE: it is difficult to get a straight answer from Iobit support who now claim it's not their fault I don't  get the full amount back because of tax, even though they took the money out of my account without my permission in the first place. I have been back and forth on a ticket and still the try to give me as little information as possible. I have never dealt with a company as bad as this. Will update you to see if I ever receive the full amount of £78.46 ( not 48.62 EUR ) which I feel now has been stolen from my account.Date of experience: September 17, 2024",1

Narottam Zakheim,GB,"Oct 27, 2023","Excellent Products - Excellent CompanyI've been using iObit products for over a decade now.  I've been with them since the very early days of their company where they were offering free performance apps for the pc.  Ive watched them grow and develop and procude a truly exraordinary collection of apps to refine and streamline the user experience of windows.  These apps keep my system running at top performance at all times.  The programs are super light weight... they actually improve performance rather than drag it down like so many others.  These products help your pc to consistently run better than it does day one out of the box... and this really says something considering the nature of windows.  Im an avid gamer and my system can run titles beyond the spec of my pc fluently... much better than more powerful systems that have not been optimised.  I consider my suite of iObit products to be a core part of my pc using experience.  I have even used these products to help friends who were suffering with dying systems.Recently I had an issue with one of the products not being able to install due to a reg 5 error.  I contacted support and they worked tirelessly to detect and help me sort out the issue.  They even gave me a complimentary license to make up for the time lost.  Absolutely top class service.  This is how you can judge the quality of a company... not by how it is when things go right... but how it goes when things go wrong.  iObit have shown themselves to be completely honourable and I will gladly continue to use their products in the years to come.Date of experience: October 27, 2023",5

Kim Deppe,US,"Jul 24, 2024","I have used IOBit software for years…8I have used IOBit software for years and never had problems. 3 months ago, I received an email saying my subscription to one of their programs was in need of renewal; so I renewed it. Only to find out that it was not expired or near expired. When used their support link to contact them, I was ""assisted"" by the most obnoxious person I have ever encountered in customer service. I was asking for the expiration date of my software to be extended since I had what amounted to double coverage for that particular program. It took a month for me to get that straightened out. Since then, my laptop took a crap and I am using an older one that already had IOBit programs installed but they were out of date. Since it was late at night and I needed the program right then, I renewed them through a package deal where I got their Driver Booster, Disk Defrag, Advanced Care System and Software Updater for several PCs at a discounted price. I just installed them all and on every installation there is fine print at the bottom of the permission to install screen asking to install other software, namely itop VPN, itop screen recorder and itop EZ Desktop. Although I opted out of installing these programs, I still ended up with the itop VPN and the itop screen recorder installed on my laptop somehow. I uninstalled them using IOBits own uninstaller and there doesn't seem to be any problems with it but I do not like the fact that they installed other software that not only did I not ask for but that I indicated to their installer that I did not want. They should recognize that its not all about money all the time. I do not think I will renew any of my subscriptions when they expire after these 2 experiences with IOBit.Date of experience: July 23, 2024",3

Ron Redner,IL,"Updated Jul 19, 2023","ASC Pro - For Great Overall System Maintenance...I have been using Iobit's Advanced System Care Pro version for several years. Despite some of the negative reviews I have read, this has not been my personal experience with the company. To begin with, ASC Pro performs reliably. I know what to expect and the company has demonstrated throughout the years that they are responsible and are not interested in playing games with me. When I have opened a ticket they went above and beyond what I had expected of them and actually helped me with an issue I don't really think fell under their realm of responsibility. But their training is such that they genuinely wanted to help me. That's a great attitude. It demonstrates that they sincerely have my best interests at heart.Their product - ASC, quiets down the activity of my desktop to a tolerable minimum and I hardly hear my PC making noise after I run a system scan.I don't rely on ASC for Virus Scans, because my experience wasn't that great when it came to virus scans ASC performed. However, that said, as a overall system maintenanceprogram, it is reasonably priced (I think I paid around $13 through a promotional).They also gave me the option up front, to be able to turn off autopay, which I do in fact turn off.I recommend ASC Pro, because I think the value I get out of ASC PRO by far justifies the expense in terms of peace of mind and not having to endlessly babysit my desktop and tinker every few hours. Also, ASC Pro comes with many advanced features that are not included in the free version and if your PC starts having issues and things aren't working right, there is a toolbox that I use that has allowed me to resolve pressing issues which I would not have been able to resolve on my own without a lot of effort and pain. ASC Pro made my life much easier.Date of experience: July 20, 2022",5

Gary Laws,GB,"May 14, 2023","Great software, ruined by bullying sales tactics.After a year of using IObit products, I completely understand why they polarise their customers so badly, and have such an odd reputation. I purchased a sale bundle they offered last year, which included their system maintenance, driver management and software uninstaller apps. I later went on to add their screen recording app. The software itself is all great, especially their screen recording app, but even though I subscribed to many of their apps for 12 months, they will still carpet bomb you with various nags for apps you may absolutely not require. For example, my VPN is part of my Norton installation, yet IObit keep trying to push their own VPN, it's infuriating! Based purely on the software performance, I would have no problem either subscribing to the same apps for another year, or buying the lifetime licenses for several of their apps. But I simply don't want to go another 12 months with their frequent popups, sale notifications and nag screens. It is such a shame, because their screen recording software (iTop Screen Recorder) is brilliant. There are a couple of reviewers recently that advised users to simply install better browser AdBlock extensions. I do not believe that these are genuine users, because the popups come from within the background app services running within the operating system. They have nothing! to do with your internet browser. It is also frustrating to see IObit staff replying to Trustpilot reviewers, and yet they do nothing! to address customer issues. The apps themselves are fantastic, all IObit would need do, to enhance their reputation, is stop trying to bully customers into buying more products from their catalogue. All my apps have recently expired, and I would love to purchase another set of licenses. But because of the sales tactics used by IObit, I am instead rather looking forward to removing every atom of software from my laptop, to get rid of all the popup noise that the IObit apps generate.Date of experience: May 14, 2023",3
Andy Expert,US,"May 7, 2023","Decent tools, bad company management.I downloaded the Advanced System Care and Driver Booster, free versions on both. ASC works like CCleaner. Cleans junk files, checks the registry, etc. Plus, other features that CCleaner does not have, even in their paid version. Driver Booster won't update all of your drivers for free, but it does show you the ones that require pro, so you can manually update them if needed on your own.Now the bloatware issue. As of 5-7-2023, installing Advance System Care will install 3 pieces of software: ITop VPN, Screen Recorder, and Screenshot tool. I can almost guarantee that the company is going to reply and say that I ""forgot"" to uncheck the boxes. I used Revo to clean uninstall it and redownloaded. Same three bloatwares. They are easy to get rid of, antivirus didn't flag them or anything. Also the VPN program added a desktop UI widget that showed my CPU usage and say that I wasn't secure, even though I was already connected to my paid VPN service, so seems the program has no idea how secure my system actually is and just tells me that I need to turn on its VPN service. It's scummy tactics and bad marketing. And annoying.But hey, its a free program. After reading reviews of people who paid them for the PRO versions I can say I would never pay for any of this. Any company that continues to badger its paying customers to spend more money doesn't care about its customers. Which is a shame because the tools seems to be pretty decent. We should show companies (with our wallets) that they shouldn't be harassing customers with popups to buy more services when they clearly would rather your products just do what they are supposed to do and not interrupt their work. So, until they actually get their marketing issues resolved I would avoid paying for their PRO services. But this is an issue that most companies have right now, $ > :)tl:dr - It will install some easy to remove bloatware, company will say it was your fault, it's not. Software seems to work just fine but pro features don't seem worth the money, and according to a lot of paid reviews, they keep pushing ads for their products on you.Date of experience: May 07, 2023",3

In my case $77 for a much lower-priced single product (uninstaller which is a GREAT program!!). When they do that do that EVERY item gets renewed!!

HERMAN G. LEWIS,US,"May 7, 2022","Subtle issue with ASC toolbox featureI have been a user of Advanced Systems Care (ASC) ever since it was first released several+ years ago.   I first installed the first free version on my Gateway computer and used this for a few years.  Upon realizing how well it was working for me, I upgraded to the latest PRO version at that time.   It was only about a year and a half ago that this old Windows ""98"", then ""XP"" and then ""7"" based same Gateway computer gave out, that I decided to get me one of the ""newer fast guy"" laptops on the market.   All the time, I was using the Gateway with the various Windows programs and the different versions of ASC, I never, ever had any issues with the ASC and all its ""toolbox"" goodies and along with using the Malware Fighter.   The ASC kept me out of trouble, clean and functioning very well.  After I bought my Lenovo Yoga C740 (15.6"") laptop which had and still has Windows 10, and installed ASC 14 PRO and the Malware Fighter, everything was still good.  It wasn't until I later realized that after I used the ""Driver Booster"", which is in the ASC toolbox package, that strange operational things - like the touchpad not working or the sound shutting down - started to happen.   To make an almost two-year fight story short, the issue turned out to be that the Lenovo laptops have their own unique drivers and when the Driver Booster program was run, the Booster program determined the Lenovo Driver to be out of date and replaced it.   The Lenovo just did not like that exchange.   After almost two years we figured this out and I first would only use only the Lenovo updates to update the Drivers and whatever and second, I just don't use the Driver Booster at all.   When a computer’s resident applications needs it, these computers are smart enough that they will go off and find their own updates on the internet.  So, in conclusion, I can say I am totally pleased with the operation of the ASC 15 PRO and its toolbox of all sorts of goodies and have found no problems with any of the support apps, with the exception of the Booster on the Lenovo laptop.   In comparison, the two Gateways my wife and I had and my wife’s current HP Envy have had no issues with the Driver Booster nor any of the other resident apps in the package.  I bring this event up, in that I recall reading in these reviews that several people were having computer performance issues when the ASC was installed.   These folks may want to look at things like the drivers if they are using  the Driver Booster in the ASC package.   Another app I am also watching is the Software Updater.   At this time I am still experimenting with it as I am not totally comfortable with that one yet.   Hope this info will be useful to someone.Date of experience: May 07, 2022",5

I assumed (really dumb) I was dealing with iobit and you people have alwayw been perfectly happy to work with me when I have goofed up something.  I had to start a complaint in pAYpAL to get my money back.  Unfortunately I turned around and uninstall what was in my computer to make sure they couldn't get back into my stuff.  I have Advanced system Care and just uninstalled the defrag program.  Can you tell me if I no longer am hooked up to have Advanced system care handle my defrag issues.  Thought you should be aware of this.  If you are working with them they are  probably giving you a bad name out there.Date of experience: April 15, 2022",5

Mark Russell,US,"Updated Apr 11, 2022","Renewal issueI've been using Pro for some 10 years now and love the product. I do however have one complaint. Every year when I renew, the new expiration date is always 1 year from the date of purchase, not a full year added to the existing subscription. Every year I have to make a complaint to support, which I'm happy to say they aways fix, no problem. Seems like it would be easy to differentiate a renewal from a new purchase but it happens time. Addition: Good morning,Your reply mentions renewal of an existing code vs. purchasing a new code, and I don't recall ever seeing that option. I do shop around a bit for the best deal as the purchase price varies from site to site. I queried the last purchase over the effective date issue and their reply indicated that I would need to contact IObit. I know at the time of purchase that their advert seemed to indicate that I was purchasing a renewal. Now I don't mind telling you it would be my preference to make purchases directly through IObit, but that option for renewal is always the most expensive. It would seem to me that a long-term customer such as myself would receive a more ""special"" price offer to encourage renewal. In any event, I do wish you to know that I'm pleased with the product you provide and have been since my original purchase some 10+ years ago. I'm further pleased with supports timely responses to issues. Thank you.Mark K. RussellDate of experience: April 04, 2022",4

You really need to work on the help area, if someone gives the wrong email you send the activation code to that email, and the person CANT ACCESS THAT CODE without that code, It makes no sense to lock someone out due to an email mistake. If not for the phone number I found It would have taken longer than the 3 days I tried to fix my issue. It was very frustrating...

David Ruben,GB,"Mar 12, 2022","I foolishly agreed to try updating and other software installed without warning nor permissionI foolishly agreed to try updating IObit Software Updater to latest version, and found without asking my permission or any tickbox option to untick, it also installed iTop VPN, iTop Screen Recorder and iTop Screen Capture.I don't mind suggestions for other software tools (kinda annoying, but reasonable for companies to do, and just occassionally something that peeks my interest), and I can't really complain if offer comes with tick boxes defaulting to ticked provided made very clear this optional additional items unrelated to main item allowing to politely decline ...  but automatic install of other software without any mention or permission... my response was to remove the iTop items immediately, and then considering the untrustworthiness demonstrated by IObit I removed their trial Software Updater and Driver Updater programs.This a shame as I thought they might be interesting to purchase... but now this company just lost my trust for a stupid advertising-marketing ploy, and worse yet I'm hunting for review sites to vent my experience.Date of experience: March 12, 2022",1
