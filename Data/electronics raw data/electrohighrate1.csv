Also, I have emailed this company a couple of times regarding a phone number or chat option, and they have not responded. Also, when you click on a website when you are looking for information, many times it will not take you to the link that you clicked on. It just sits there. Trying to use their service has been frustrating. You have to send them emails when you have a problem, and they don't respond for 2-3 days. When they do respond, they usually don't address all your questions. I doubt that I will continue to use them when my subscription has expired. Look elsewhere!Date of experience: January 06, 2025",1

No sooner than TotalAV got my account number, they tried to withdraw money two times and Bank of America of America send two alerts immediately declaring the transaction as fraud and cancelled my debit card. The Bank of America has one of the best fraud detectors in the US. TotalAV is a fraud. Do not stake your money, even a cent with this company.
