Customer,GB,"Updated Aug 22, 2024","The good, the bad and the very ugly......Firstly, the theme we bought is very good, Vendy Pro.  Suits our needs perfectly and has helped our business.  I don't want to leave them but as you'll read, we might have to.The support used to be amazing but then something happened and they have become slow and quite unresponsive to emails.  I recently renewed my support for Vendy Pro on themeforest.  However, I noticed that theme has not been updated there but has been on other platforms. (templatemonster).  I have asked why the update has not been updated here and no-one answers.  I feel cheated and have wasted my money.We have finally moved on and would recommends that nobody gives them any business.  This is not how you treat loyal customersDate of experience: August 08, 2024",1

Kourosh Nivesse,FR,"Jan 27, 2024","Really disappointed by this theme where…Really disappointed by this theme where customer service is extremely unresponsive (48 hours for a reply). And the theme is really poor quality.As I have an artistic activity, I wanted to increase the speed of my site and increase its visual appeal.It was a terrible mistake to use this theme, which gave me a site speed of 9/100, which drastically reduced my conversion rate.Then, charging around thirty dollars for 3 free applications that can easily be found on the shopify store is really a load of rubbish.Pure anarchism and I will do my utmost, if reimbursement not made to shout loud and clear at what point your platform allows crooks to sell ""service"" that does not have a regulationDate of experience: January 20, 2024",1

Wdk,ES,"Jul 26, 2023","Unprofessinal Company. Do not use.Do NOT use this company. Their refund policy is trash. If you are not sure about the theme you want you have no chance for refund. Many other companies offers refund so I suggest going with another company than Zemez. I installed the theme and I didnt like it all. Hard to work with, problems and time consuming. I gave up after a day trying it and then bought another theme from another company and finished my site in a day.But they still wouldn't refund me even days after the purchase so 169 usd in the trash.

Ariel Woolf,IL,"Updated Jun 7, 2021","Rude, unprofessional and unhelpfulContacted them because for some reason they responded on the ticket I had opened on TemplateMonster regarding a theme I purchased. Only after a day of chatting did they clarify that they have no connection to the theme and that everything and anything they do would be custom as they are not related to the theme. It was not clear why they were on my ticket, and they seem unfamiliar with basic ecommerce concepts like layered navigation.Also, the FB messenger rep was rude and unhelpful.Unimpressed.Date of experience: June 07, 2021",1

Manfred Kraus,DE,"Jul 25, 2023","Zemez theme and Zemez support can only be recommended...In the beginning I had tried free theme for my Shopify store until I decided on a theme. When I wanted to buy a license of the selected theme from Zemez, I unfortunately bought it on an unauthorized site and had problems with the optimization of the site.Since the support of the unauthorized site could not help me and I came across the website of Zemez by searching for support on the web, I asked Zemez for support and learned that I bought a theme without a license.  Since I have businesses and I didn't want to use an unauthorized license, I purchased a license of the theme from Zemez and installed the theme in my Shopify store.For any question that arises about the theme, I have received a response from Zemez support with the solution. Also, when deciding which variant of the theme is best to use, I was given excellent advice by Zemez support, not only with a recommendation but also with the reason why to use this proposed theme. What stands out above all is that with the reply emails I received not only the text but also screenshots with explanations. The theme from Zemez and the support from Zemez can only be recommended.Date of experience: July 25, 2023",5

I was informed of the price of $108, however, upon completion of the purchase, I saw that $165.98 was debited from my account. There was no indication on the checkout page that this was the cost in AUD, and even Template Monsters support did not state this. When I needed help with any support questions, the only option available was to create a ticket and wait three days. I brought this issue up with Shopify, as I wanted to be sure it was not my own fault, and received a quick response as they stated it was theme issues not Shopify after all Shopify is the biggest platform in the world. My customer experience has been unpleasant, and from what I have seen, many others have had a similar experience. Your theme has major issues and your customer service should be available 24/7 for customers all over the world. Chat options should be available to provide quick responses, rather than waiting nine hours for a reply. Due to this experience, I request a full refund as soon as possible. You have not only taken my money, but also my time. I would appreciate swift action in this matter.Date of experience: December 20, 2022",1

My latest request was where I needed help in changing something in CSS that I could not straighten out myself. Whereas most of my service requests have involved tweaking, there were many times in the beginning of using the Monstroid2 Template that I just needed help in understanding the template which is very user friendly. There were several times that what I thought was simple turned out to be not so simple. So instead of solving the problem using chat, a job ticket was opened and in a short period of time I got the answer(s). This is a company that you can rely on for 24/7 support.
