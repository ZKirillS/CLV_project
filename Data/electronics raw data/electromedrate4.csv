Quoted us £400 minimum to extract our photos from external hard-drive and then came back in 24 hours with a quote for over £800. Speculating on our desperation to get all our family photos back is really pretty disgusting. Cited 'complexity' of job and 'expert professionals' despite telling us in less than a day that the hard drive could 100% be repaired. Don't get sucked in, they will skin you alive.

So effectively, if they couldn't do anything with my drive, I would be burning my money and paying for nothing. They then want to charge you £18 to have your drive delivered back to you!!!! Shocking.

Saira Sky-ler,GB,"Aug 5, 2022","I thought I had lost years' worth of childhood pictures and videos, I got nearly 4,000 back which is amazing!I google and found The Ontrack though I thought it might not work.  The team and Lucas were very responsive and communicated at every stage of the process. The online process is useful to see the stages.After years I decided to send my WD passport portable to the repair shop for recovery data. They were unable to fix it. They said my hard drive is stuck in one place and they thought it was a charging port problem but it was head stuck. I thought I had lost years' worth of childhood pictures and videos, I got nearly 4,000 back which is amazing! The price is a bit pricey but they are very kind by giving me a discount. I highly recommend it, Thank you!Date of experience: August 05, 2022",5
David Silverfish,GB,"Mar 8, 2023","A mixed bag, less good than I wishedThe good bits:  Company is VERY professional in many ways with detailed report and follow up.The bad bits:  I gave a full explanation over the telephone for what had happened (ransomware attack).  I was advised to bring the server into them.  I did this.  I asked for a receipt (as I am handing over £3,000 of kit) and was told ""you will get an email in a few minutes"" - I didn't.  It took 24 hours.  Just over a day later, I had my report which told me, in a VERY professional document EXACTLY what I had told them before bringing it to them and nothing more.  This cost me £1,000.  Further, bearing in mind that they stated that they can recover from ransomware attacks, the report went on to say ""If they (the data files) are also encrypted, we will not be able to recover the individually encrypted files"" which rather negated the whole point of taking the machine to them.Date of experience: February 08, 2023",2

I initially took the Drive to CentreCom for data recovery and it was confirmed the Drive had failed:  Unfortunately CentreCom could not restore it.  I used the Ontrack service and analysis confirmed that the Drive was in early stages of failure and a good data recovery result could be achieved.  Like so many other reviews, the best result possible was achieved:  100% Data Recovery.  With thanks to the Ontrack team for the professionalism and keeping me informed every step of the way.

I was informed that the HD crash was too severe to recovery anything.

Rubin,GB,"Updated Mar 13, 2022","ONTRACK broke my laptopSo, this is how it works. Ontrack never mentioned to me that recovering the data from my Surface Pro required the laptop to be broken. All other official companies (including Microsoft, Currys, etc) confirmed that, to open it, the screen needed to be broken. Ontrack's offer includes the shipping of the device paid by them. MISTERIOUSLY and despite following the instructions to package it, the device is broken during delivery, allowing ONTRACK to carry on the inspection and not being responsible for the damage. Despite Ontrack arranging delivery they will not take responsibility for breaking it and will not claim the damage to the delivery company. You won't be able to claim anything because you did not arrange delivery. I ended up with a lapton broken by Ontrack and no data recovery. AVOID these scammers.Date of experience: March 13, 2022",1

My entire document and picture store was in that box and has been for many years.  I was in the middle of purchasing a home when my server crashed taking all of my data with it. I sent the drives in but needed to delay the processing of the order. They held everything for me until I was ready to proceed.

Since I work at an engineering firm, I had a few of the electrical engineers look at the laptop and they were able to diagnose the problem to a shorted BGA chip.  I decided to send the laptop to Ontrack before trying to fix it so I don't risk loosing my data.  Ontrack had the laptop for about 10 days and replied that they were not able to recover the data nor the laptop.  when I received the computer back, there were missing components on the logic board and Ontrack had drilled holes in the PCB rendering the computer completely unrecoverable, even if I decided to send it to another data recovery vendor.  Since their model is ""we don't get paid until we recover your data"", I believe Ontrack rushed the diagnosis and went straight to invasive techniques without notify me that ""if this fails your computer will be unrecoverable"".

Lori,US,"Jul 4, 2021","Will never go anywhere else!!Learned about Ontrack from my local repair shop. My hard drive had been dropped and was in the worst possible shape for repair or data recovery. Best Buy quoted me $1500 and that was only if I paid a $50 non-refundable assessment fee, shipped it out, and waited to hear back. Ontrack pays for you to ship the item to them, reviews and assesses the problem, and sends you a quote. Then you decide if it makes sense to you. As this hard drive had 15+ years of work and photos on it, I was thrilled to find out that not only did they feel confident they could recover my data, they were able to do it for much less than a chain store with an overhyped name. I would like to say I would have paid anything to get my data back, but the reality was that I could not afford what I thought it might take. And while it still cost a great deal, the process and the trust I had with Ontrack was worth every penny. I would use them again in a heartbeat and will recommend them to everyone I know.

Alexandru Calugaru,GB,"Dec 1, 2021","Incompetent or thieves, difficult to decide.I don't know where all this good reviews are coming from. I have sent my SSD drive to them for a free valuation. After they've evaluated the drive, informed me that there's severe damage and I have to pay another £160 for them to give me the list files that could be recovered which would have costed another £1400. Overall £1600, on case of urgency more than the double.After paying the £160, I have been informed that the drive is not recoverable. Which brings me to the conclusion that they are either incompetent (couldn't recover or identify the problem) or thieves. Either way you would prefer to keep away from them. if by any chance you'll be asked money for additional survey, don't waste your money, they either don't have a clue or want to steal at least something for doing nothing.Maybe my review might look a little too harsh, but it's based on a real experience, where they actually had to deal with a real issue. Probably most of the other cases could have been solved with a data recovery software, cause I don't think they are capable of actually recovering anything. Probably the money for the survey was to send it to other company that actually can do the job: (tried to recover data with the data recovery software and when failed sent me a message that additional survey is required, they had to send it to proper recovery company). Well i have already tried the software recovery before sending it.Maybe it's better to ask who they use for data recovery and go directly to the other company that actually does the job.Date of experience: December 01, 2021",1

m1t4cpp,CA,"Feb 15, 2022","Deliver what they claim, efficient service, and available to track progress onlineI had superb experience engaging ONTRACK Data recovery Brisbane. My 3.5 years old Seagate Backup Plus Hub was suddenly unreadable from any laptop on a Sunday afternoon. I spent a few hours that evening researching potential reputable data recovery companies based in Brisbane. Honestly, ONTRACK was my 2nd choice, just because its location was rather secluded and one negative review that I read on Google. Having said that, ONTRACK was the only one that could do the work due to its affiliation to SEAGATE and may have the right tools to deal with any SEAGATE hard disks. I was informed about this detail from the first company I went to (thank you to the director). I phoned ONTRACK on Monday and spoke to Michaella briefly about my issues. I made an appointment to drop off right away. I was thankful that I was allowed to come with my hard disk in person, unlike the third company that I contacted. She was very efficient in communicating what I need to know about the process, gave me the form to fill in, and confirmed with me orally if my data was that value due to the minimum potential cost that may incur. I was glad for this extra gesture of her. Having heard of how valuable my entire data was, she took me seriously and explained all the detailed processes that would happen. What she said was the same as what was stated on the website, which I spent a couple of hours before reading it. She also ensured me for the policy of “no data, no fee” and that I didn’t have to pay any down payment during my drop-off. I half knew that it was a long shot to get all my data back as the first company I talked to mentioned how serious the damage was. Within the next 24 hours, I was informed that the damage was indeed severe and ONTRACK openly said they couldn’t commit to recovering those data and that they needed more than a week. They asked me if I still wanted to proceed and if I wanted to commit the payment required cost shall any data be recovered. I said yes to the pay and the waiting time. I certainly know that it was a kind of complex recovery process. Hence, I understood why it cost me that much. Long story short, I was informed about  73% of my data was recovered 10 days later. They gave me a link to virtually check and ask questions before making a total payment online. I am also glad about this opportunity. It meant that I can see what I would get before transferring money. I took the time to check and seek confirmation. Michaella answered my concerns promptly. Once payment is done, I got back my data in the new external hard disk (included in the cost) within a couple of hours. Also, ONTRACK provided you with an online account where you can always check the engineers’ progress, so you would know what has been done to your damaged product at any given time. This feature gave me so much peace of mind and I could manage my expectations well. Thank you engineers for all your efforts.Date of experience: February 15, 2022",5

I already knew that I would spend several hundred euros and had no problem doing so because the files I wanted to retrieve were important to me. I paid the 250 euro fee to have a diagnostic, which is absolutely fine. Communication was good, but the turnaround time stated on the website is bogus, so be prepared to wait a long time. Almost 1.5 months later (instead of the 5-7 days they mention) I received a detailed diagnostic that stated that almost all of my files could be recovered. Over 250 thousands files were green, aka ""good"", ""100% retrieved"", with ""NO STRUCTURAL or READ errors"". 1500 other files were deemed ""yellow"" or ""red"", so either completely corrupted or partially retrieved, so might not open.The report lead me to believe that most of my files had been saved. I was over the moon with happiness! I gladly accepted the invoice and paid over 800 euros.I received the disk two days later, and got a nasty shock: 99% of the green/ok/good files are actually corrupted. You've read that right. The files with ""no read error"" or ""structural errors"" cannot open.Basically, and this is absolutely crazy, there is ZERO difference between the ""partially retrieved"" files that I was warned might not open, and the""good"" files that were supposed to be 100% retrieved. The ""good"" files cannot be opened, and if they can, which is the vast minority of them, it is missing half of its data (for example, photos are half black, or the text turned into gibberish) making it completely useless. The report I paid 250 euros for was therefore not only useless, it was false, which is criminal for a company that claims they are the best in their field. The green files do have ""structural"" and ""read"" errors, contrary to what was told in the report. If I had known, I wouldn't have paid several hundred euros. Why would I pay over 1000 euros to receive useless files? What a joke.What I paid for is basically a drive full of unusable files. What is the point of the $250 diagnostic then? Isn't it to let you know which files will work so you can actually decide if paying several hundred to get them is worth it? So I send an email to the agent I've been talking with, and crickets... They no longer answer. Funny, they were very responsive when I hadn't payed yet, calling me on the phone, responding to my emails almost immediately. And now, they are nowhere to be found. You have 1 month to ask for help after the disk has been sent and they make sure to not answer so that time runs out on you. Despicable practice.I've been completely misled by Ontrack because no one in their right mind would pay that much to receive corrupted files. I'm flabbergasted. I could have gone to any local repair shop and got the same result for for not even 1/5 of the cost.Date of experience: September 01, 2023",1

Hopefully they go under soon and make the world a better place, where packages get delivered on time, where employees won’t lie to your face and where “end of business day” doesn’t mean 9pm!If you actually want your package delivered, in one piece, and on the agreed upon day you should steer clear of this scam company. We have had their drivers get lost and actually take a package home with them, after marking it delivered, and come back the next day (a Saturday) in their personal car to deliver it. Can we say theft?! We have video of their driver lobbing packages out the side door of their hoopty, throwing packages over a fence that were marked fragile. The list goes on and on.

I stupidly didn’t back up my phone, it wasn’t very old so I assumed it was ok. I had recently set up icloud for my photos but before I could move my images (over 10,000 of them) the iphone 8 complained there was not enough storage and suddenly itunes popped up with error 14 and the phone literally wouldn’t switch-on. I took it to a local phone repair shop and they said the only option was a factory reset, I just couldn’t believe it, all my photos would be lost forever. However, I got in contact with Robin England at Ontrack and he and the team in the US have worked on my phone for the best part of 10 months. Yesterday I was given a drive with all my data – pictures, videos, messages, contacts, everything I thought was lost forever. As I understand it, this is the first time anyone has been able to recover data due to this error – the team at Ontrack have gone above and beyond to help me, and I cannot recommend them highly enough. Thanks to their determination to find a fix for this error they have saved my many, many, years of memories that were irreplaceable. Safe to say I have now backed them up.

I have owned a company that developed a software solution with a large software development staff of over 20 people, for the wholesale retail industry. I trust one can understand of having dozens of software personnel who developed this solution through  the directions of input from 100's of customers over 30 years of time  was very costly. In fact given all it is priceless. My situation was that I had my software backed up on all types of media, including 5 tower units. Last december 2019 I lost everything I own to a fire. The only item not disintegrated was a half melted tower computer that I had to pry apart with a crowbar as the case was melted by the intense heat. I did get the scorched drive out and send it to ONTRACK. I can tell you as a IBM reseller for over 30 years, my experience in the industry that these people our  simply the best. The recovered all my software at a very reasonable price. I trust that anyone can understand their is simply no words of appreciation that can express the blessing of getting my software back. I am hopeful that I may be able to sell my solution which will be a financial beneficial facture in rebuilding my home. SHould anyone out their have a similar situation look no further. call ONTRACK.

Susana  Rodriguez,US,"Mar 12, 2021","AMAZING COMPANY!!!!!!I was soooooo Lucky to have decided to get a second opinion. I am a photographer and my Western Digital 4TB was deemed inaccessible In October 2020. I had 8 weddings that had not been  given to the brides and 2 of them had not even seen their photos. I was desperate and sent my drive to first a company in Montana called FILES SAVERS DATA RECOVERY . On November 12th, 2020 FILES Savers said they had good news and it was that they said that they could recover my data and the bad news was it would be $2400.00. I would call them on a daily basis and all they can say is that it was a Firmware problem. They said it all the way till February 8th, 2021. What triggered me to get the 2nd opinion is because one of my brides sent me an email stating that it was Unacceptable to wait so long for their photos. So On February 9th, 2021 I asked the company to please return my drive but never told them that I was sending it elsewhere so they would not sabotage my drive in anyway shape or form. On February 11th, 2021 I received the drive back and sent it out to THE AWESOME ON TRACK DATA RECOVERY on February 12th, 2021 they then received it on February 15th, 2021 and they started the recovery as I even paid the extra $100.00 so I did not have to wait 10-20days more . On February 16th, 2021 I called in the late afternoon and spoke to Ashley she was so fabulous and funny , because she knew I was very stressed with this situation. She stayed with me on the phone and sent Mr. Adam Mergen (THE ENGINEER) an interoffice email about my drive and at this point he had told her he had 90.1% of my data. Then February 17th,  in the afternoon I received a message stating there was 99.8% of my data was retrieved. At this point I was very ecstatic and happy. They then sent me the invoice I paid it and a Brand new 2tb  drive was sent out to me on February 18th and received February 19th, 2021. ON TRACK IS AMAZING!!!!!!!! They recovered 90, 717 photos. This is the best move I've ever made and all my brides have all their photos. Thank you ONTRACK for the upmost professional Company I have ever dealt with :)Date of experience: March 12, 2021",5

They arranged collection of my faulty drive then analysed the damage. I received a report that provided the estimated data recovery percentage and then the option to proceed or cancel (with no costs incurred). I chose to proceed. I was set up a login to their own portal where I could monitor the progress of the job and read the reports they produced regarding the data loss. The recoverable data was copied from the faulty drives image and sent to me on an external hard drive. I asked if this could be swapped for a SATA drive so it to go back in my PC which OnTrack arranged and delivered with no hesitation. If you require this, I would suggest making it clear to OnTrack at the beginning to save the few extra days it took for the collection and redelivery. Amazing service.

I am less satisfied with my communications with office staff.  In the case of the successful job #2, I received emails from three different individuals at OnTrack and would have preferred to communicate with just one person.  Of these three individuals, two made errors that I was able to quickly correct by writing back promptly.  One egregious error was in the final billing, which was incorrect -- too high (in favor of OnTrack).  The other error had to do with OnTrack waiting for my shipment, which had already arrived at OnTrack a few days earlier.

I found Ontrack through Western Digital´s website.From my first call to Ontrack, Emma looked after me every step of the way, by helping me to understand the process, keeping me updated, sending me the documentation in the post as I could not print it at home and even helped to adjust the initial quote, which I highly appreciated.Every time I called, the Customer Service was excellent and every single person I spoke to was extremely friendly and helpful. Especially Tom and Joe who helped me when I got the new device with my data fully recovered.During the whole process I was kept updated of every step via a portal and calls. Excellent job from start to finish and I can only recommend Ontrack.Date of experience: May 11, 2020",5
MR S J ROBINSON,GB,"May 7, 2020Verified","Recovery of restored hard driveI had a hard drive which had been accidentally restored back to ""day one"" by a local PC repair shop!Sent to Ontrack for data recovery to try to recover a couple of databases. After a few emails, they were able to recover databases that were useful to us (although not the most up-to-date versions).The recovery process took longer than their stated times but otherwise, very good.Date of experience: May 07, 2020",5

Intrepid Aunt from London,GB,"Updated Apr 8, 2020Verified","Memories recovered. A professional Ontrack service.I was referred to Ontrack (before the lockdown) from Apple Genius for attempted data recovery of my failing HDD on my MacBook Pro. I found Ontrack to be both professional and courteous. There was an initial delay in the forms I needed to complete but they resolved this very quickly and kept me informed all the way through. Data recovery creates anxiety at the thought of all the potential lost memories and information - but Ontrack recovered 99% and very promptly sent me the external disk and my original hardware as a next day courier service during the COVID-19 lockdown. The process is not cheap but you can’t really put a cost on lost memories and important data that is restored, safe and available for your use once more.Date of experience: April 08, 2020",5

I had tried several other cheaper local hardware shops before, where I had no success. Yet Ontrack did a great job collecting the phone, recovering the data and re-delivering the handset in a very timely manner. They offer a premium service, but it is worth paying for if you care about your lost data. Very professional.Date of experience: March 24, 2020",5

Stella,US,"Mar 19, 2020","OnTrack Ninjas saved my data - kudos!!My 2001 iMac failed. Apple store at Southdale referred me. My husband confirmed that he had a great experience getting his back-up drive recovered a few years ago. I concur. I dropped off my drive late on a Friday afternoon and heard back the following Monday that it looked good for recovery. A couple days later, looked excellent. (Of what was recovered 0 partial files and 0 errors.) I got a call that it was done and due to social distancing the drive came by Fedex, the next day. And the next day my IKEA bag and blanket I transported the old one in arrived. And they wiped and recycled the old one. Fabulous service: regular updates, professional and friendly people, and I’m grateful to get back more data than I thought was possible. Probably all of it-haven’t set up new iMac yet. I think I got some extra service because of social distancing and am thankful for that. The OnTrack team is Ninja. Highly recommend.Date of experience: March 19, 2020",5
