Tony,US,11 hours agoVerified,"GREAT service!My daughter saved up money to purchase a refurbished an HP Chromebook from Reebelo, through Walmart. When she received it though it was missing it's charger. A few short & courteous exchanges later, brought a ""brand new"" charger to our doorstep within a couple short days. They left nothing half done, they extended her warranty & issued her with a discount towards a future purchase for her trouble.

Memfer Demferz,AU,Updated 3 days ago,"Useless MIDDLEMAN companyRead the bad reviews guys!!!!! They sell refurbished stock with aftermarket parts, basically taking broken items and making them run long enough for you to be happy, initially, but these items are problematic because they don't have manufacturer parts and are likely to fail or not run properly. Additionally, they also sell scam warranties that are just cheap enough that you pay them for a sense or reassurance, but these warranties are borderline scams, you will be without an item and will never get your money back. They painfully gaslight you with nice emails and gaslight you as they purposefully misconstrue your emails.  I mean just read the bad reviews here! ACCC, more of us need to notify the ACCC.

Ben W,AU,6 days ago,"False advertisingFalse advertising. Don't believe the 'premium' category. The phone I bought was falsely advertised as being 'premium' but came with low quality replacement components.The screen is a cheap LCD, not an oled as the iphone 12 was released with. This was not specified anywhere in the listing. The back glass was a cheap replacement that broke from a minimal contact of being in my pocket with my keys. I have an iphone 13 to compare it to in this regard, which has sustained much higher impacts with no damage at all.The battery that was advertised as new is also faulty, exhibiting erratic behaviour.I am extremely disappointed with the product and it is not at all what was advertised.When I contacted them for a repair or replacement they said that the cracked back glass voided the entire warranty and weren't interested in hearing about the falsely advertised 'premium' phone with cheap parts that was delivered.Date of experience: November 13, 2024",1

shemlinex muchai,AU,Updated 8 hours ago,"So I innocently bought an iPhone 14pro‚Ä¶So I innocently bought an iPhone 14pro as a Christmas gift on 19th Dec 2024(I know I was late so I assumed id maybe get the order a little after the day). Together with the phone I also bought a screen protector.1)Only the screen protector seemed to have a tracking ID on the 23rd. I don't think much of this and assume both items must then use the same package or parcel. 2)I also notice I used a wrong suburb code for my address when I shipped my order. Its too late to correct the address from rebeelo so I get in touch with the couriers; Aus post; with my one tracking ID.3)The aus post can be annoying to reach and be in touch with which I finally do on 07/01/2025 with valid info that my package was in lost and found warehouse but no way it had any kind of phone inside since it was a letter and the weight was too low.4)That confirmed my fear that the package/ parcel shipped out was just the screen protector! For 3 weeks now!5)So did my phone even get dispatched? Rebeelo got to my case and with their quick response I found out they had not posted my phone's tracking ID. Thats the only issue with them, they don't post tracking IDs of shipped out items separately. I think its a bug on their dashboard, 3 stars only because the customer care team responded to my emails promptly. Hopefully I get my phone no later than tomorrow now that they emailed my phone's tracking linkUpdate: 13/01/25I haven't received any useful information from the team despite sending out emails on the ticket. Clear this case ASAP the confusion can be stopped by the sender of the parcel. Date of experience: January 10, 2025",1

This is far from the condition advertised.When I reported the issue, I was offered a mere $35 partial refund, which is insulting given the condition of the phone and the amount I paid. After further communication, I requested a fair partial refund reflecting the true value of the phone, as I rely on my phone for work I did not want to replace it.

Skylar,CA,Updated 3 days ago,"Wrong phone came in, not first issueI‚Äôve had some minor issues with receiving items of lesser quality than I ordered (with no compensation or notification of such, before or after the fact), but this last order was the last straw for me. I had to replace the last iphone I got from Reebelo because it shattered (my fault, not theirs), so I figured I‚Äôd replace it with another red iphone 12, but this time I got the battery upgrade. Two weeks go by, I realize it‚Äôs the day my shipping estimate showed, and my phone has NOT been shipped out. Reach out to customer service ‚Äî turns out the estimated shipping date given at checkout is NOT an arrival date, it is an estimated DISPATCH date, and they were very cut and dry about informing me of such, as if I should have known when that isn‚Äôt made clear at all. Fast forward to today, about a week later. My phone arrives. I‚Äôm excited because I love hacing a red iphone and the one I am currently using had to be put in a skin case to keep the glass from falling off, meaning my phone was completely hidden. Immediately upon opening the box, something seems weird ‚Äî there‚Äôs a screen protector and a bumper case that I didn‚Äôt order in the box on top of the phone box. Weird, but I‚Äôm not about to complain.Until I realize the next few things: the phone box itself was never taped or held shut in any way, and the bubble wrap was not very tight in the box. It ABSOLUTELY could have flown out at any time, but fortunately didn‚Äôt. The charge and SIM tray pin were both left in the box directly against the screen, which FORTUNATELY didn‚Äôt get scratched. And to top it all off: it‚Äôs not even the phone I ordered. Instead of the nice, red iphone 12 I ordered, I got a black one, which I suspect is why I got the screen protector and bumper case alongside it without being charged. I have yet to hear back from customer service, but I suspect the suggested fix will be to send the phone back and have a replacement shipped out. If I had any faith that that would take less than a month, I‚Äôd likely take the offer, but I can‚Äôt go more than another few days with a shattered phone, so I‚Äôm just going to have to suck it up and use it. Edit: After further inspection, I discovered that I also did not get the 100% battery capacity upgrade that I ordered and the phone case is for an iPhone 12 Pro Max ‚Äî the phone is an iPhone 12, so it doesn‚Äôt even fit. No response from customer service as of yet in regards to any of this, either. Date of experience: January 09, 2025",3

Magdalena Herreshoff,US,7 days ago,"DO NOT buy from ReebeloDO NOT buy from Reebelo. Reebelo uses vendors from all over the U.S. and their Customer Service is outsourced and inflexible. I bought an iPhone 11PRO on November 11, 2024 and didn‚Äôt receive it as promised. Customer service said they would look into it but they were taking a long time. I figured out from the invoice that it was coming from Texas. I found their phone number for the vendor and talked to someone in a warehouse who said they had sold the phone to someone else and initiated a credit which I received same day. I then ordered again from Reebelo an iPhone 12 Pro which came from vendor Cellfeee in NY. When downloading my data, the phone immediately overheated. Reebelo had me return it after clearing out all data and sent me a replacement from same vendor Cellfeee that immediately overheated as well and the phone stated battery was severely degraded. Reebelo wanted me to clear it out again and sent it back to them. This is all on my time to clear it out, pack it up and take it to UPS Store which is not nearby. I requested instead a refund for the battery replacement for $89. They refused. Cellfeee had offered $30 which I countered with $45 for half the cost. Now Cellfeee says it cannot do anything and that I have to return it to them to make a decision on the condition of the phone. They don‚Äôt care that the fault lies on their side. Customer Service sends out canned messages. I have decided to keep the phone and replace the battery at my cost.

Victor ,AU,"Jan 5, 2025","Most frustrating customer service‚Ä¶Most frustrating customer service ever.... I emailed back and forth explaining that there must be some kind of glitch regarding addresses. My PayPal address is my old address, but my reebelo address is the correct one. After purchasing, I received an email and it had my old address on it. I emailed explaining if they can simply change the address, but to no avail, they reccomended cancelling the order and re order again. Now I'm currently waiting here like a sitting duck for them to re list the specific phone I was gonna buy. I don't know there should be a better system in regards to confirming and clarifying the address or an easier way to change your address after you've paid. Clearly I'm not a scammer trying to change the address because sending an email to customer service using my email address that I ordered with. Extremely frustrating. It's made me reluctant and turned me off from ever buying from reebelo again. Date of experience: January 04, 2025",1

I said from the beginning to repair or replace and you didn't do either. You said the vendor fixed it and I said I didn't want it back but wanted a refund. I was worried it wouldnt be fixed still. You said it was to late the vendor as sent it back. You sent it back and wow yep I was right it still wasn't fixed. I'm still wanting for a explanation as to why you sent a phone back that still wasn't working properly and you never answer the question.You service is appalling.I would like to state if you had fixed the phone the first time like you said you did I wouldn't have had to send it back again. Before the physical damage you are referring to wouldn't of happened if you returned me a phone that was in working condition.

Nikki,AU,"Jan 5, 2025Verified","Do not buy -Sold an International Model Be very wary of purchasing a phone from here. The iPhone 13 that I received was an international model and at no point was it stated that the phone was a US model. Within a week of owning the phone, I noticed the back screen was cracked and I had not dropped the phone at all. I was only just able to take it to the Apple Store to get it repaired and I was told it was an US model which changed the type of repair. It would cost $570 to repair the phone, instead of $150. I contacted Reebelo about being sold something that was not Australian and got told nothing would be done.

A month later, when I was committed to the new phone (having set it up, bought a cover, etc), they informed me I could either pay more than $400 extra or return the phone for replacement with the one I originally ordeed. When I sought to negotiate (as this is totally unaccpetable for a vendor) they were polite, but completely refused to take any real responsblity for not communictaing properly, and would not negotiate at all about amounts to pay.
