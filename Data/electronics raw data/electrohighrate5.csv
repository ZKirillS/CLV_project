Smith Poston II,US,3 days agoVerified,"Poor Customer Support from Swappa.comI've purchased an iPad 8th Gen last year from Swapp.com and it was iCloud locked, I wasn't able to use the device for four days upon arrival until the seller had it unlocked. This year I purchased an 128gb iPhone 14 Pro Max and it had a shattered camera lens inside the phone and the phone smelled like smoke. The seller didn't want to refund my money and they didn't want to admit they sold me a bad phone. It cost me $60 to ship the phone back to the seller UPS to get a full refund. They didn't want to reimburse me the shipping cost to return it. Both experiences buying devices on Swappa.com have been a total nightmare.

Psy.D,US,A day ago,"Swappa Staff/Management Lacks Integrity, Is Not Objective, Has Doubled Standards, and Poor Business Practices – DO NOT USE!Ugh! I really have no respect for cowards. That energy is so off-putting. I loathe people who behave like that, cower behind anonymity and delusions of grandeur, and empty titles. This is exacerbated when it is done by a place of business…Swappa back in the day used to be AWESOME. I had my account for OVER 10 years(~36 sold items, ~18 buys, 5-star rating on ALL sales), with ZERO issues. That is until recently…The short:I bought an item from an “enterprise” seller. According to Swappa’s own terms, certain data should be available immediately after you remit payment. There is evident contradiction, ambiguity, miscommunication, and hypocrisy in the treatment of laymen sellers and “enterprise” sellers and their FAQ section. Remember, I have plenty of experience with buying, selling, refund, PayPal, returns, fees, etcetera. *The “enterprise” seller was unable to provide information that should have been made available and/or readily accessible once payment was tendered, according to their own policies, both parties were in violation of this. As a result I opted to decline moving forward with the transaction and asked the “enterprise” seller to just cancel the order, minutes after they said they did not have the specific device information. Weird. They ultimately wanted to assess me a 10% return/restock fee for a device they never shipped out or could even provide me the requested information on and took me through an unnecessary claim with PayPal for almost a week. I reiterate this was dumb and to simply cancel the order/not accept the funds/ or I would be forced to involve PayPal. I waited exactly 24 hours and got nothing. I escalated to PayPal, Swappa deletes my account, I win my PayPal claim, I contact Swappa, no response. TrashDate of experience: November 11, 2024",1
JB,US,2 days ago,"Horrible support and rude customer service, if you call it that?Horrible place to sell or buy anything. They go by the policies until you have a problem. They blame the usual carriers that ship and that's it. It also says in the policy: Seller is responsible for providing reasonable support for any issues related to the item sold. ..The SELLER stated ""I've already dropped it off at the post office"". That would be the last time I ever heard from him or her? I did all the leg work for this seller and the swappa ""support team"" as I called numerous times to USPS to find and figure out where this package was? The ""support team"" did nothing only to say allow 24 hours? Thanks team for the help..  I guess they didn't research anything as the 24 hours would have fallen past the 2 days the seller is suppose to ship.This place didn't help me with anything,. I hope whatever he or she shipped is an actual brand new unopened box with a phone in it? It's not looking good so far though?

AN,US,"Updated Jan 6, 2025","Avoid Swappa - Zero buyer protectionsAvoid Swappa. There are zero buyer protections from scam sellers if anything goes wrong. You are on your own in getting a refund by filing a dispute with Paypal since Swappa does not handle the payments. Also, Swappa has no way to make the Seller pay for the return shipping of the defective item. Swappa's vetting of listings is limited to an automated check of IMEI (for phones) and staff looking at the pictures, so anyone can post a perfect picture and sell a defective product. In summary, it is just a glorified Craigslist and you have to blindly trust the seller. Be prepared for the hassle of a Paypal dispute for any defective item refunds, even though you pay a 3% buyers fee to Swappa.Date of experience: November 27, 2024",1

credcomm,US,"Jan 4, 2025","I am a first time buyer on SWAPPAI am a first time buyer on SWAPPA.  Swappa was recommended to me by a friend.  “I could find a great deal on phones there.” What I got was $246.14 worth of grief and loss.  I bought a phone as a Christmas gift.  The price was right and the seller indicated it was in great shape (true) and unlocked ready for T-Mobile usage (not true).  Day after Christmas we took the phone to T-Mobile to activate.  We were told that the phone was security locked and could not be unlocked.  We then went to Best Buy for a second opinion.  The tech confirmed that the phone was locked and probably stolen.  He said they see a few of these cases from time to time.  He suggested to contact the seller for help.  This is when the grief started.  When I went back to SWAPPA, they put me in contact with the seller, who is no longer an active seller. The seller swore it was a personal phone and was unlocked prior to shipping, but could not provide a security code to unlock.  Date of experience: November 10, 2024",1

Richard Walsh,US,"Dec 24, 2024","It’s not what it used to beIt’s not what it used to be. Here’s my experience:- the site is flooded with bulk sellers, individuals are relegated to the bottom unless you pay them more- the price they suggest is bogus. I had an iPhone 14 Pro in great condition, but only 80% of the battery remaining. Their suggested price was $550. This is crazy high; most resellers don’t even want the phone unless it’s 85%. - I eventually reduced the price to $440 and one person showed interest. - after paying for shipping and fees, my take was down to ~ $400 and I had to shlep it to pack it and schlep it to UPS- I should have just traded it into apple for $375 - faster, much easier, no dramaDate of experience: December 24, 2024",3

B. H.,US,"Dec 23, 2024Verified","I would shop here again.Everything was a great experience from finding the right device to purchase process, to receipt. I would say that while Swappa’s standards for each category of product is excellent, it does give room for the seller to not provide all the details regarding the product and leaving some things up to guesswork. So far the product has stood up to the promises made it just would have been beneficial to know it wasn’t going to come with a charger. Additionally there was another post for another item I was looking at that said the item was one thing but when you looked at the description it was another. Not sure if this is common or a one off. Other than those 2 issues I would say I love what I got and the price I paid for it. It was a pretty seamless process.Date of experience: December 23, 2024",4

Louis,US,"Dec 22, 2024","As a seller, don't expect Swappa to provide you any goodwillThis is a review from a seller's perspective. This is a lengthy review but I take this seriously. In spite of my rating, I believe in the potential of Swappa as an equal opportunity marketplace for buyers and sellers, and am sharing personal details in hopes that this provides insightful feedback.SUMMARYIf you dispute a buyer, Swappa will absolutely disregard you and leave you to your own devices without goodwill for you as a seller. To be honest and fair to Swappa, a majority of sales were positive. However, one bad sale made me completely lose trust in this marketplace to provide the bare minimum amount of seller protection.MY POSITIVE EXPERIENCES WITH SWAPPAUnfortunately, due to the character limit, I need to keep this brief. I really admire Swappa's commitment to upholding standards for sellers in regards to legitimacy and accuracy of goods. This gives me confidence as a seller that the buyer understands exactly what they are purchasing. The forum/board commenting system is great and I really like being in direct line of communication with each potential buyer to keep everyone honest. I can also praise the payment system and PayPal integration, the website interface and user-friendliness, and high userbase that promotes sales. MY NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE WITH SWAPPAHere, I will recount the full details from my perspective as best I can with the limitation. I sold a used mint condition phone. It was by all accounts, as reviewed and approved by the Swappa staff, a mint condition phone, with multiple detailed and multi-angle photos and video. Following sale of the item, I took a video of me placing said phone into the shipping labeled package as a safe measure. The buyer then opens a case against me stating that there were scratches on the phone with photos, none of which were previously present. There were many back and forths, but to summarize, I was firm in that the buyer was not being honest. I will admit that Swappa staff was very quick in responding to us, and that due to the several reasons, this case seemed fishy to me and I probed with some assumptions. Ultimately, I complied with the buyer with respect to benefit of doubt and in support of Swappa staff who asked of me to resolve this. The buyer proceeded to leave a negative review, which I felt was unjust so I reached out to Swappa for support but was rebuffed.I can accept the monetary loss. However, what I couldn't accept was the response and lack of goodwill from the Swappa team. Hopefully these emails with Swappa help to explain the situation, as well as how it was handled. EMAIL 1 FROM ME""Hi. I would like to request a removal of customer feedback for ---.The buyer complained about the condition of the item not matching my description of it, even though I provided numerous images and a video that clearly show otherwise. I am still highly doubtful it is my fault due to several reasons which I won't belabor here, but I complied with the buyer's demand for a partial refund as not to further escalate the issue and inconvenience the Swappa team. I had no motive or reason to deceive the buyer as I understand ultimately there is no real way to prove foul play on their part once the item is in their hand. And I was willing to accept that risk.I won't raise any more issue beyond this message but my only request is to please remove the feedback. I will take the loss with the partial refund but the feedback from the buyer on top of that stings more.""RESPONSE FROM SWAPPA""I'm afraid we're unable to hide the feedback for this sale since it seems to meet our guidelines: [Link to guidelines]Feel free to work directly with the buyer to see if they're willing to adjust this on their end. Thank you.""EMAIL 2 FROM ME""Thank you but I have to disagree per the guidelines (false summary of the sale) as the feedback stated ""Seller listed phone in mint condition but I received phone in fair condition."" I am adamant that what I sent them is as I listed. I have further proof (a video of me packaging the phone). I forewent showing to nip this in the bud but it was not an admission of fault. I've already worked with the buyer for a solution that satisfies them and don't wish to further engage them. I apologize for pushing back but I feel very seriously about this. I completely understand buyer protection and giving them the benefit of doubt but that should at least, even a little bit, go towards the seller as well. So I am appealing to you, seeing as the buyer is now satisfied whether they are in the right or wrong, to give me as the seller the benefit of doubt and satisfy both parties. There is little downside for Swappa to remove the feedback.""After this, I was rebuffed again similarly and this was left unresolved for me. All in all, I understand nothing can be proven but it was hard not to feel betrayed by the complete one-sidedness.Date of experience: December 17, 2024",2
