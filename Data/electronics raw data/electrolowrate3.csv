Ju,US,"Updated Dec 20, 2021","Call Privacy Concerns!Been a VIP Connect user for 10+ years. I would rate this service as fair to good on most days.However I've recently noticed that calls made to Nairobi (actually Kenya as a whole) display a local number on the recipient caller ID rather than the callers number. I found this quite suspicious and notconvinced calls are guaranteed privacy.This wasn't the practice when I started using the service.If a call recipient has Truecaller app installed it displays the call as initiating from some random Kenyan numbers and names not related to the caller initiating the call/VIP account holder.Date of experience: December 20, 2021",3

Moreover my calls were interrupted several times at a rate of $1.00 per five minutes.After the first purchase, though not satisfied, I said let me try again, may be it was an isolated case and thus recharged but it became worst. Most of the interrupted call happened after the recharge proving that it was not isolated case.I'm disappointed beyond measure.I want my money back!Date of experience: February 16, 2019",2

I called wanting to re-credit my mother-in-laws account. I was on my lunch break, so I had limited time. After several minutes of questions about myself and being asked for everything but a DNA sample. Again, this re-credit was not for my account, and I had her phone number, name, etc. All I wanted to do was give them money, but apparently they didn't want it. The last straw was when he asked for the name of her phone provider. What DIFFERENCE does this make!!! By this time I was irritated and asked why he needed to know. At which time he hung up. I didn’t bother to call back. I deleted my account and will recommend that all my family and friends do the same.

Jane K.,US,"Aug 21, 2018Verified","I called for assistance in making an…I called for assistance in making an emergency call to Kenya on 08/14 and it took exactly 1hr 04 minutes to get assistance including the reps hanging up on me not once, not twice but thrice!!!! The 1st rep had zero attention to detail. She asked to confirm my number and she would repeat a totally different number twice. When she finally hang up on me in the middle of the process, I decided to try again but t the 2nd rep was no different; annoying back and forth and then hanging up on me too after I requested to speak to a supervisor who she said was busy and wou look d call me later. I reiterated that I was trying to make an emergency call and if no one could help, I asked if the credit I had just added to my account could be reimbursed so that I could try another provider but I got the run around again. I finally decided to figure it out and I made my call. I was very disappointed...PERIOD!!!Date of experience: August 21, 2018",1
