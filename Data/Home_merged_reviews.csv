And none of the 3 bulbs showed a manufacturer or ID number either!  Once I explained the situation she asked a couple of quick questions and immediately determined the current bulbs had an E11 base.  She then sent me to their website and guided me through a drill down search to a page displaying multiple options that she was also looking at.  After discussing additional size and illumination specifications alongside each photo there, we both agreed on the best option.  And upon receipt they fit perfectly!  It was a small $57 order that took a lot of her time, but she was extremely knowledgeable, patient, eager to help, and friendly throughout.  Kudos to Bulbs.com for having such a professional salesperson on staff!  I encourage you to ask for her the next time you call.  Jeff R.Date of experience: October 17, 2024",5,Home

Reine Parsons,US,"Dec 7, 2024","Bathroom Light Fixture BulbsOne of my bathroom light fixture bulbs had burned out, but the other two remained illuminated.  I went to the big box hardware stores looking for as close of a match as I could to the one that burned out, but I could not find anything.  I tried a regular bulb, but it just did not look right and it stuck out a little bit farther than the other two.Buying lightbulbs used to be easy but now it’s pretty painstaking to make sure you get the right one for the right fixture with the right wattage, lumens, Is it halogen?, Is it an LED?, etc.Finally, I had enough and I did a Google search and I found this wonderful company, bulbs.com.  I called them and a young gentleman answered the phone and I told him my situation gave him all the information off the burned out bulb. We talked about what kind of color light that the other two bulbs present and long story short, this person that I talked to on Monday, December 2, 2024, got me hooked up with the correct bulb that I need and I ordered 12 of them that way I can have them should any of the other bulbs in my bathrooms burn out I will have the replacements on hand.I can’t remember his name, but he hooked me up with the correct bulb, an  LED 9W/60W, A19, 800 lumens/brightness, 3000K soft white light appearance and the bulb is frosted. The bulb also has that hard coating part that takes up the lower half of the bulb as well.He gave me the information, I went online, I ordered the 12 and about four days later FedEx was handing them to me in my driveway.  If I ever need another lightbulb for my new construction townhome again, bulbs.com is the only place I’m going to go.  The person that helped me was so genuine and so professional and so sweet and so caring, and he really was drilling down and asking me a lot of questions to make sure that he got me the right lightbulb for my light fixture and so for that, I am eternally grateful.  I think bulbs.com is exactly what we need more of in this country in terms of online retailers.  I’m very happy I found them online. I’m even happier that I made the phone call to the company and I’m thrilled that I don’t have to worry about light bulbs for my bathrooms for about eight years.

I reached out to BD to inform them of the situation and they sent me a new order free of charge. They even honored my request to send to a different “safe” address when I advised them of issues my building had been experiencing with stolen packages. With understanding customer support like that I will forever give this awesome company my business.

Solid Apollo excels at all three, but that isn't particularly uncommon for electronics. What sets Solid Apollo in its own class is its support for these products.  But a video camera from amazon and expect hours of marginal support for how to make it work. Buy a new iphone and expect to drive back to the Apple store to get help, or watch hours of youtube trying to trust who to trust. At Solid, I've hit snags understanding products before and after buying them. I call. I talk to someone in tech, recently Cameron. It's like getting real knowledge over the phone that's applicable. On one occasion I wanted to hack one of their new products to make it work as the older versions I used. They explained how to do that. Who does that? Who cares enough to do that?

I wasn’t sure where to start with LED strip lights until I found Solid Apollo, a local store that specializes in them.I made an appointment with Cameron, and from the start, he was incredibly helpful. I explained my project, and he patiently walked me through all the details—helping me choose the right light temperature, explaining how to connect everything, and teaching me about the aluminum channels and diffusers for a clean, professional look. His expertise gave me the confidence I needed to take on the project myself.I ended up purchasing everything that day, and over the next few days, I worked on installing the lights. The result? My bookshelves look amazing! The LED lights perfectly highlight my collectibles and books, and I’ve already received countless compliments on how great it looks.

I am an amateur electrical worker and had found exactly what I had looked for on previous other sites who's products did not fit the actual size for my existing replacement parts.I was able to place an order with all of the information I had gleaned from the site and was needing those exact sizes. I placed my order, and then received a call from the shop stating that all the parts would not work together, But instead of omitting the one part that didn't work. He who will not be named, asked me a ton of questions making me explain my project in excruciating detail and cancelled my original order only to send me a smaller version of what I actually needed and had originally ordered, and omitted that part that was not compatible.My project is underway, but I am much less then happy with the look, because the size of the channel is way smaller then the original size I needed and had ordered originally. And he delayed my project by 1 week. My next project may not come from Solid Apollo. The sales person was nice, but did not sell me what I needed.

If I bought just the 38” channel, then likely the Aluminum Channel would not have been damaged.   Customer Service was excellent in addressing the damaged items!

Justin,US,"Updated Oct 27, 2023Verified","Would not recommend.  Use a local supplier.  Don't order direct.The LED rope had color spots go out after installation and we had to replace 4 different runs with new rope.  This was factored as a bad install, even though we had no issues in other areas.  We also had a faulty driver that was not credited due to installation error.  The troubleshooting guide we called, said we probably shorted out the driver when installing it, and if we sent it back, they could do a diagnostic to verify.  We didn't waste any more time or money on sending this back, as the seller had already made their decision when talking to them on the phone.  I will always go through a local sales rep in the future to avoid these frustrating issues.UPDATE:  After seeing my review here, Solid Apollo reached out and gave me a full refund on the faulty LED driver and shipping costs.

The description of events will,US,"Sep 12, 2022Verified","Poor Excuses from inquiry to delivery of PurchaseIt is quite interesting as to how a sales rep will treat a customer on the phone. I live in Las Vegas and had been traveling a bit for work as I am a very busy Programmer and Production Electrician. When I made the inquiry, and followed up with a request that the item I purchased to be delivered to the Vegas 4wall/usedlighting.com location, I was told that we couldn't do that because then other hands would have to touch it and that only the purchasing customer could receive the item. Turns out that last part was a lie of a rude saleswoman. She stated that I ""would need to process paperwork and an additional payment for customs"". That was all handled by UPS and I was never charged anything additional. They Only needed my company TIN. This email exchange happened on Aug 8th.When I was sent tracking information. I informed that I needed help getting UPS to hold at an access point for me and the email I received on the 18th ""I am neither the shipper nor the receiver I cannot jump in . What does UPS say about holding for pick up. Once an order hits customs it cannot be changed I will reach out to vendor and see if there is anything they can do""Again, I just do not understand why they sales person was so dedicated to filling a lie and letting a customer have something they paid nearly 10K for just chance that it would not get stolen!I gladly would have paid for any additional handling that the item would have required to be able to pick up at the local shop, but instead I was told off over the phone. Not only that, but when I had asked a week prior to receiving the item for it to be rerouted to an access point. I was told that she tried and had no luck. This causes me to believe that this saleswomen did not even try, nor does she care for return business. I was literally saying prior to this how much I liked 4 wall and would try to bring more shows through if the LD's/Clients I worked for were putting out to bid.Date of experience: August 18, 2022",3,Home

Rodrigo,MX,"Jun 1, 2023Verified","Positive Buying Experience, but Crucial Detail Omittedand overall, it was a positive buying experience. The website offered a wide range of used equipment at competitive prices, and the purchasing process was smooth and hassle-free. However, there was a significant oversight in the product description that left me disappointed.The equipment I purchased did not come with a crucial part mentioned in the description - the ability to upgrade to Hog 4 software. It was not clearly stated that an additional upgrade costing over $400 would be necessary to unlock this feature. This omission was disappointing because it significantly increased the overall cost, making it less worthwhile compared to buying new equipment that already includes the desired features.While the equipment itself was in good condition and worked as expected, the lack of transparency about the upgrade requirement dampened the overall value of the purchase. It would have been helpful if this important detail had been clearly mentioned in the product description or highlighted during the purchasing process.Despite this issue, I appreciate the prompt and efficient customer service provided by UsedLighting.com. They were responsive to my inquiries and helped resolve other concerns I had during the buying process. The shipping was also prompt and the equipment was well-packaged, ensuring its safe arrival.In conclusion, while my experience with UsedLighting.com was generally positive, the lack of mention regarding the required upgrade to Hog 4 software was a significant oversight. This unexpected additional cost made the overall purchase less cost-effective, bringing it closer in price to buying new equipment. I would advise potential buyers to thoroughly review product descriptions and inquire about any potential upgrade costs before making a purchase.Please note that this review reflects my personal experience and opinions, and other customers may have different experiences.Date of experience: May 04, 2023",4,Home

I could not believe she took the time to call.

Edwin,US,"Feb 25, 2016Verified","Plug-in dimmers don't work with this dimmable T9 LED bulb.Got a couple T9 dimmable LED bulbs for my picture light, to replace the T10 incandescents.  The T9 bulbs are great except for one thing.  There aren't any plug-in type dimmers that work with these bulbs.  Tried a touch pad type Westek dimmer.  No good; flickers at all brightness settings.  Tried a Lutron slide-type ""Credenza"" dimmer; same result.  Both these dimmers claim to work with LED bulbs.  Lutron has an extensive list of ""compatible"" bulbs for their dimmer, but they've apparently never heard of the Bulbrite brand of bulbs.  Bottom line: MAYBE these dimmable T9 bulbs will dim properly if you have a hard-wired wall dimmer switch, but they won't cut it with the available plug-in type dimmers.Date of experience: February 25, 2016",4,Home

Bob,US,"Feb 21, 2016Verified","Customer Service LackingI have done business with this company in the past and had no complaints.  This time, however, one of the bulbs I ordered was broken.  I believe this was a result of the way the bulbs were packed for shipping.  These bulbs come in packages of two and are mounted on cardboard with plastic over the top.  The packages were stacked in a box with nothing in between them; the box had no top; and packing paper was laid on top.  I contacted customer service to suggest that they do a better job packing this type of light bulb, and the response I received was ""seriously?""  This sounded to me as if the representative thought I was lying, and I didn't appreciate that.  As these bulbs cost less than a dollar each, I will give it no further thought.

The only reason that I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 was that all the documents that I was able to access after the sale, for which I paid by credit card, still showed the total due.

Anonymous ,US,"Updated Nov 30, 2020Verified","POOR customer service!!!!POOR customer service!!!!The packaging is horrendous.. uses styrofoam which breaks easily and makes a huge mess PLUS its horrible for the environment. for the prices you pay for items you'd think they would package in better packaging that doesn't make a huge mess. expect to vacuum when unpacking this. It's hard to restore items in original packaging because of that awful styrofoam. customer service is horrible. returns are not free and expect to pay upwards of 40$ to return 3 items. if you opened the plastic they consider the item used and will refuse your return so if you are unsure about an item don't open the plastic to inspect your item or else they won't accept the return. items are made in CHINA not worth the full prices on their website. if you want something wait for their sale don't buy it full price, there's no price adjustments if you miss the sale. they are missing the key aspect of customer service and don't honor anything favorable to the customer. be 100% sure you want to keep the item before buying or lose $$ paying for your returns.Response: I specifically told you I'll never be buying from you again, wherein that statement do you see I was satisfied.Date of experience: November 30, 2020",1,Home

It took me less than 5 minutes to remove them when I took the lamp out of the bo.  Some of them were not really attached to the lamp at all.  The lamp itself seems okay although I have not yet had it installed.  The lamp itself is of a hefty weight and I like the shade.

I ordered the 16 Inch Round Vintage Metal Wedding Cake Stand in Gold on March 13th for my wedding on May 14th. I received a notification email that my order shipped on March 30th. After checking the shipping status and seeing that it was still in the “Label Created” status, I contacted Amalfi Decor’s customer service regarding the status of my order on April 12th. I was told that it was now considered “lost” and that they would not be able to send me another at the time because they were out of stock, however, they had the 14 inch version of the same exact cake stand in stock that they could ship right away and I would receive a $10 refund for the price difference. I agreed, since I could still make that size work with my wedding cake, and received the refund. Now, it is May 6th and I STILL have yet to receive a cake stand from them and they STILL have $57.49 of my money that was remaining towards the 14 inch cake stand. Since it is too close to my wedding, I have already had to order a different cake stand from another company and am trying to receive the remainder of my refund. I have called several times on multiple different days and no one answers. I have also sent multiple emails requesting the refund and have not received a response. I have had to escalate the issue to PayPal to attempt to get my money back since Amalfi Decor does not want to correct this issue.

sylvia fernandez,US,"Jun 14, 2020Verified","Sometimes an apothecary jar can mean much more than just a jar...A few weeks ago, post full-rent, I bought 4 beautiful apothecary jars as the ""crown jewel"" display for our buffet table, just as this COVID19 pandemic nightmare was hitting my town, NYC. We all know what happened here, and that those here, are still fighting to stay alive and keep our loved ones safe. Nothing is ""normal"" any more. What people may not realize, is that at the start of the pandemic, all courrier services (rightly) suspended ""signature required"" deliveries, in order to keep service pros safe.  Needless to say, unsigned packages left unaccountably, are a theives dream!!! We ended up calling customer service @Amalfi decor for SEVERAL replacements, which were repeatedly sent out and stolen.  I can't recall how many replacement shipments the ever patient Maria there sent us, but we FINALLY recieved our GORGEOUS apothecary jars after MANY failed/stolen shipments! I'm glad we tried and tried to get those darn jars!  IT WAS SO WORTH IT!!! I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THE WONDERFUL CUSTOMER CARE there at Amalfi Decor, Maria specifically. I know they lost $$$ inventory while trying to deliver my order.  One thing Amalfi decor HAS GAINED IS A LIFELONG FAN AND CUSTOMER.  In a time of great uncertainty, with so many ""normal"" aspects of life seeming to unravel, and formerly dependable services like parcel delivery, not performing well, it is a true comfort that a company in business this day is willing to go the extra mile, PLUS, for a customer.  For all this, THANK YOU,AMALFI DECOR, FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.  My home feels like a HOME thanks to Maria's effort. It means a lot since we are still in self quarantine!

Products were received in no time, which was great.  But in the end, I no longer needed them.  What's unfortunate is their return processing.  You essentially are on your own. The information I used, from their website to return my products, turned out not to be the correct address.  So as of right now my products are in the Universe somewhere.  Super unhappy.  Ensure you understand their return policy and hold them accountable for the correct return information.  Shame On Businesses!As an update to this review; once my review was read by the company, they contacted me right away to make all things right, right away.  It didn't workout the way they planned, however, the products were shipped back to them and they did refund our money so all is right in the world.

E Ez,US,21 hours ago,"SCAMMER ALERT!!! REPORT THIS COMPANY AS SCAM. INTERIOR ICONS is a total SCAM. Please DO NOT ORDER anything with this company. Although their website looks legitimate, reviews are FAKE. I will explain to you how they are operating and making their money: So when you order furniture, technically you are bound to exchange ONLY. What they do is they will intentionally send you damaged furniture, and then you have to reject the item and have them process a replacement. So first strike is: They over charge you on shipping over $150 dollars. Then they send you shattered-broken-damaged items that they won’t refund you on and they will only offer a replacement that will take a couple of months and most likely it will be damaged again. They also do not respond to any emails. I requested a cancelation on a pre-order that was never canceled. Btw this happens to pretty much every single costumer. It’s their tactic. I found a website with customers reviews. Just google Interior icons reviews.  There is no phone number and their costumer service will only communicate with you up until they say they processed your replacement and they will stop after that. I also can assure you the furniture designers are not the few folks from Seattle in the photo they put on their website.  INTERIOR ICONS STOP Scamming. I’m in a process of taking legal actions so nobody else becomes a victim of fraudsters like them. I made a few phone calls and sent out a few emails. Please EVERYONE continue reporting them to your financial institution. I personally have reported them to major creditors and they are in a process of flagging them. Soon their website will be taken down. INTERIOR ICONS, DO NOT  respond to this review. Your responses are INVALID. Trust Pilot please contact me directly and I’m happy to provide you with all the evidence-information needed. You need to FLAG them as well. Thank you Trustpilot!

Bot responses are useless and emails I am getting back are saying the order will ship soon and still no shipping confirmation.  Very disappointing as Christmas is approaching and we have no couch in our living room. The time frame listed on their product page is inaccurate, seems like they want the sale but don't deliver as promised.

However, the two pieces delivered were black and green—completely different from the all-black couch I purchased. To make matters worse, there is no customer service phone number, leaving email as the only option for communication, which has significantly delayed resolution of this serious issue.I am appalled that Interior Icons failed to ensure the accuracy of my order, especially after such a lengthy and delayed shipping timeline.

We have already endured months without a proper living room sofa, sacrificing comfort in anticipation of receiving what we believed would be a quality product.With Christmas passing, we have had to cancel our planned holiday gatherings because of Interior Icons’ negligence.

Jamie S,US,"Updated Jan 2, 2025","BewareBeware. They have an F Rating from the BBB. I ordered 4 barstools. While it showed in stock, they didn’t ship for 10-15 days. When they arrived the boxes were damaged and every leg of the stools was sticking out of the box. And of course every stool was damaged because of this including some bent legs. They made me unbox them and kept asking for photos over and over again. Then after all that they wanted a video. ALSO NOTE that they do NOT have a phone number. This is all done through frustrating emails. Once I took them out of the boxes I realized how poorly they were packaged. Heavy barstools in flimsy boxes with minimal packing to protect them. This wasn’t a FedEx issue it was an Interior Icons packaging problem. I told them I didn’t want them replaced because it would clearly happen again if that’s how they ship. They refused and said I was required to take a replacement. Now it’s been another 10 days and no shipping etc. I also filed a complaint with BBB and they got back to me that Interior Icons is NOT responding to BBB which it says on the site is normal for this company. I will never buy from them again. I will also be refusing the shipment if the boxes show up damaged again. The kicker on all this is I now have to dispose of 4 large barstools because Interior Icons said that I’m responsible for disposal. All this company needed to do was accept my request to cancel my order. I’ve been posting the link to BBB on their Facebook ads but they keep deleting it. lol. Apparently they’re well aware of their poor customer service because it’s hard to find a place to leave them a review. They control the reviews shown on their website and that’s why they’re all positive. UPDATE: FedEx attempted to deliver the replacements today but the boxes arrived damaged just like the first time. Customer service told me to refuse shipment if this happens so I did. They can now refund my money that they’ve so far refused to do.

When I had to move from Arizona to be near my family in September, I notified Interior Icons, and they sent me a note indicating that they'd updated the delivery address to my new home in CT.  However, they did not do that, and all three lamps were sent to Tucson where the new home owner refused them. I engaged in a series of email conversations with customer service reps, but there is NO PHONE for a customer to contact Interior Icons, and the help they offered was really just no help at all. They offered $75 off a future order. Believe me, there will be no future order. Having read other reviews of Interior Icons, I realize I will be lucky if the remaining two lamps show up at all.

When the lamp arrived, it was damaged, and the process to get a refund or replacement has been a nightmare. There is no phone number to reach a real person—just an unhelpful chatbot. I immediately uploaded photos of the damage and requested instructions on how to return the item for a refund. Two days later, I received an email from ""Jennifer"" (via ZenDesk), asking for more photos of the entire lamp and the original packaging. She informed me that refunds aren't allowed for damage during transit—really?I complied and sent the additional photos, and two days later, I was told I could only get a replacement, but I could return the second one if I wasn’t satisfied. Frustrated but still hopeful, I requested a replacement. Then, nothing. Ten days passed before I received an email from ""Mathew"" (again via ZenDesk), stating they had determined from the first set of photos that there was “no damage” (which is blatantly false) and that they would not send a replacement. At this point, I don’t even want the replacement—I just want my money back!This company is frustrating, dishonest, and misleading. They claim their products are handcrafted in their own factory, but the box clearly says ""Made in China.""

A.,US,"Feb 26, 2024","Misleading shipping options and general lack of good faith I wanted to buy a marble plinth/cube side table from them during a sale they had going on. The reviews mentioned getting white glove delivery was worth it because it weighs over 100lb, so I was confused when I didn’t see white glove delivery as an option at checkout. I reached out to them to clarify if I was doing something wrong. The problems arose when:1) they told me the only way to get white glove delivery for this (130lb) side table was to order other even larger items—so basically I’d have to spend thousands to get any help with delivery. 2) this took several back and forth messages to get the above answer from them—at which point their sale was no longer happening, and they refused to honor the price I’d seen in my cart when I first reached out. Seems like in this case, it’s in their best interest to reply slowly. The fact that a 130lb marble cube isn’t heavy enough to warrant offering the white glove option that they have is wild.

customer,US,"Updated May 22, 2024","Deceitful, Questionable Business Practices My experience is that this company sells inferior quality goods. I would never shop from this company!  Using google search, Interior Icons links their website to advertise designer names which makes it “appear” that they sell designer goods for a competitive price; however, the goods they sell imitate the designer items, the items are not authentic and are of inferior quality.  Example - searching for Philippe Starck Kartell chairs, Interior Icon has the “Masters” chair for sale - but they in fact do NOT sell authentic Kartell Masters chairs, even though they go to the extent to link their website to a search for the designer and name their products the EXACT SAME NAME as the designer.  If a company wants to sell goods that “look” like designer goods but are NOT designer goods why would you name your products the exact same name unless it is to trick the customer - that is a deceitful business practice.  How is it legal to sell items that copy the designer, have the same name as the designer, but are NOT by the designer.  BEWARE! Shop elsewhere.  They will charge you a HUGE return shipping fee once you realize you’ve been duped.  BEWARE.Date of experience: April 03, 2024",1,Home

Maryna Holovanova,US,"Feb 17, 2024","Incompetent customer support. Deceiving delivery time estimates. Subpar quality. Placed an order at the end of January for 6 chairs and 1 coffee table. All the items in the order were ""in stock"" and ""ready to ship in 2 days from Seattle"". Not only they weren't shipped in 2 days or 2 business days: I received 1 chair in almost a month in a tumbled box + my coffee table. In the box the chair was wrapped in 3rd grade plastic with multiple corners and parts of the chair sticking out of the plastic, finish already scratching off of the chair. When I unwrapped the chair I discovered that the glue was sticking from in between the seams. The surface of wood is uneven, the finish is scratched and simply low quality. I'm still waiting for 5 of my chairs out of the 6 I ordered. The company doesn't have a phone number they only reply to your emails if they feel like it. The shipping company has 4 out of 5 chairs and they called me, but it looks like nobody knows where the 5th chair is and nobody cares. I actually looked at the packing  list and it was clearly indicated that there were only 5 chairs there as soon as the order was shipped and I emailed them about it but they replied in general terms of ""we'll handle it"". They are still handling it or so it seems. The travertine table was simply ok for the price that's why it's not 1 star but 2. High quality packaging on the table: comes in a wooden crate. It looks like they're getting away with low quality of products and customer support by a pretty website and low prices. I guess you get what you pay for. I've seen lots of great reviews and I believed them. Had I known that this would be my experience I'd rather have splurged on the original items and saved myself the worry and the stress.

Adriana Guerrero,US,"Dec 13, 2023","Poor costumer serviceMy experience with Interior Icons has been incredibly disappointing. I ordered the Dante Marble Table in July, opting for white glove delivery at an extra cost. However, when the delivery arrived in November, they had discontinued white glove service without informing me. I had to refuse the delivery of three heavy crates, one weighing 659 lbs and the others 214 lbs each.After much frustration, Interior Icons agreed to reimburse the shipping costs but left me to find a local company for white glove delivery at my expense. Over a month later, the table arrived damaged, in more than six pieces due to a poor delivery job by AGS (Associated Global Systems). They are sending a replacement, but I'm stuck with the removal of a 600+ lbs crate, which will be costly and they refuse to assume the cost.The customer service is conducted exclusively via email, with no phone support available. Overall, this experience has been a nightmare, and I'm currently seeking a full refund, but Interior Icons appears reluctant to take responsibility for their mistakes. I strongly advise against purchasing from them.Date of experience: December 13, 2023",1,Home

Matthias Schmitt,US,"Updated Jan 7, 2024","Red Herring Return PolicyI was attracted to their generous return policy and variety of furniture pieces. I ordered a leather chair with an Ottoman. The boxes arrived with FedEx. I had to cut open the box, otherwise, the chair would not have come out. I sat it in, and the leather was too hard, so I decided to return it. The company told me since the box was cut that they cannot accept a return. I looked at the box with an LTL shipper. The box can only be opened by cutting open the side. The chair was placed in the middle of the box and the sides were stapled together with an industrial stapler. What Interior Icons are putting in your terms and conditions is not only detrimental to the customer but also a setup and an impossible hurdle to pass as part of their 365-day return warranty. Their return policy, seemingly generous at first, is on a second look, a red herring that lures clients into purchasing from them and then, when they refuse the return, leaves you stuck with items. Then they suggest you sell those items on your own! Given that they offer you a paltry discount for items you do not like, this is a highly profitable business for them.Other furniture companies let you return items, and they even send out a company to pick them up. I cannot recommend ordering from Interior Icons.I am updating my review based on II's reply:Your customer service response was unacceptable, as was your reply. The box for the furniture is stapled in a way that it is impossible to get the furniture out without damaging the box. You refused to accept the return with a modified box, nor did you accept the return of the furniture packaged by a trucking company of my choosing. My review stands regarding your red herring return policy.Date of experience: November 13, 2023",1,Home

Well 24 to 48 hour e-mail replies to my urgent requests for shipping information combined with “excuses” (there’s no dedicated 800 # so if you have a question get ready to wait for an answer 24 - 48 hrs) Monday’s to Friday’s 8 am to 5 pm only, just doesn’t cut it in my book when one is purchasing big ticket items from their store. For this reason I cancelled a $6,399.45 order within 24 hrs of having placed it & I left them a scathing review here on TrustPilot that I’ve since deleted because to their credit they did as of 11/17/2023 fully refund my money. Thank you Emma. Now …I am however still waiting on a relatively small Order # SJ58595 (Eileen Side Table - $328.00) to show up in Interior Icons tracking portal as having been “shipped” — 7 days after placing this order it’s still not on its way to me yet but when I bought it the table showed as “in stock” & ready to ship? What gives Emma? Robert? When I made this purchase on 11/13/23 your website strongly implied that the Eileen Side Table would ship out via Fed Ex within 2 days? Whats the holdup?Please don’t make me cancel another order‼️Update…My Eileen Side Table arrived (without printed instructions as to how to put it together🙄). It’s a lovely high quality product. I’m pleased HOWEVER the hassle Interior Icons has put me through since I placed my orders on 11/12/2023 are hardly worth it. I will never purchase anything else from this company & I strongly suggest if you are considering buying from them that you do your due diligence — I UNFORTUNATELY didn’t until AFTER I’d placed my orders.

I contacted customer support team and was told the item will be shipped on december now (so I'd receive it about 2 months after the order was placed). I immediately asked to cancel the order. It was only partially refunded. I was charged a 5% fee that in a cheap item i wouldnt of cared but now im 200 dollars down no table and wasted the time .

Lucas Dias-Lam,US,"Oct 11, 2023","TWICE the item came damagedI ordered this item (the Arlo Wall Light) and the first time it arrived (9/26), the piece connecting the bulb base to the lamp arm was broken. This meant the wire inside were showing and the bulb would dangle back and forth like a pendulum whenever the arm was swung. I reached out to customer support and to their credit they were immediately helpful, offering a small refund or to replace the item. I opted for the replacement and it was promptly ordered and arrived 10/10. This time, the bulb base was fine but for some odd reason the wooden ball on the bottom of the arm was missing. I opened the box and saw it was not there, but figured it was somewhere inside the box so I could at least super glue it together, but it just wasn't in the box. If I had to give the customer support a rating it would be 5/5, but considering this product came damaged twice I think the problem is with their procurement/shipping/packaging group. I would not order something that is overly large from here again just because I don't trust the shipping, especially since the shipping charge on the original order was $99 (although shipping on the replacement was free).

Chris,US,"Sep 29, 2023","Item NOT as advertised AND refund refusedI purchased a sofa from this company several months ago and it's been a horribly disappointing experience. I only had to sit in it for 30 seconds to figure out that the construction and measurements aren't as advertised. There clearly aren't any springs in the construction, after only a brief inspection, and back height is significantly shorter than listed (21% shorter in fact).I understand that not everyone likes every product, and things can get missed in the manufacturing process, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and reached out for a refund. That only seems fair...I've been in customer service purgatory ever since. They claim that items aren't eligible for return if they aren't in their original packaging. However, sofas are shipped with wooden slats supporting the boxes so it's impossible to open the box without damaging the packaging. Their terms are quite frankly invalid and unenforceable for sofas and other large items.I just followed up with customer service again to try to get to a reasonable resolution where I pay UPS to professionally freight package the item for return. I'm not hopeful for a reasonable response given the very poor level of customer service so far. Again, the item is completely unused and in perfect condition. All I want is my money back. I didn't even want to leave this review - I'm holding out a sliver of hope that someone else at the company looks at these reviews.I'm beyond disappointed and I'm exploring legal/banking solutions due to fraud as the item is materially different from what is advertised, without a proper return channel, and it appears they wipe any negative reviews off of their website. I'll update my review if I reach a resolution through their customer service.Date of experience: September 27, 2023",1,Home

I emailed the day after delivery requesting to return the order which was for $1,3006.00. I was sent this email: ""We would first like to offer you a partial refund of $100 as a goodwill gesture if you would like to keep your order."" - This made me uncomfortable. I didn't feel they were listening to me since I stated the bar stools were too tall in my email. I emailed again and stated please send return instructions. Here were the requirements sent to me: ""Please upload 5 images: 1x of the entire original box, 4x images of the product.*In order for us to accept your return request, please upload images of the unused products) in perfect condition. Please include an image showing each original and undamaged product box with the product inside it, and 4 images showing each returned product from different angles. Please ensure that the entire item and box are shown in each picture, and show all items in each picture.""The requirements seemed excessive and I interpreted it as a way of putting up obstacles to impede returns and the vendor taking no responsibility for their items. I had 3 bar stools, was I supposed to follow the instructions above for all 3 even though I only opened one box? Their site only allowed for 5 photos max on top of that but based on the verbaige above I needed to take photos of all items. They mentioned ""show original and undamaged box"" - one of their boxes arrived in less than stellar condition, so was I responsible for this?Basically, everything in their language gave me the impression that getting a refund would be a battle. I didn't do my research and look up reviews before ordering from this company which was a mistake on my part.

The items themselves are quite low quality - I ordered the spindle clock which looks great in the pictures on the website but was exceptionally low quality for a $300 item... loud and cheap quartz movement (you can hear the ticking noise across the room), flimsy hands that bend easily, and the spindles themselves aren't even attached symmetrically. I also ordered the Petra chair and a tripod plant stand... both of these are higher quality than the clock, but they have their own issues. For instance, the tripod plant stand was glued together messily and you can see the glue dripping out from the seams in the wood. Agree with other reviewers on this site... DO NOT trust the reviews on the Interior Icons site. They clearly screen their reviews and other than responding to an email survey (which will inevitably be screened before it's posted), I don't see any way to actually submit an honest review on their site.

Shipping was supposed too be received before August 15.  It was not received and they said they were awaiting receipt in their warehouse.  I asked why their website indicates they have 9 in-stock, when they have to receive it from somewhere else.  In reality, the products are made in China and shipped somewhere else, then shipped from that location.  BEWARE: the reviews on their website are all good because they screen them and the goods are not made by craftspeople as the stock images on their site show.  I cannot even tell where this company is located...It is now September 1 and my order says it will ship in 12-16 weeks, but they told me I would received by September 15.  I'll check back in and cancel if not received in-hand by 9/15.UPDATE 9/20/23I received both chairs now at 2 different locations.That being said, the chairs are really amazing, stunning and very substantial quality!  Please understand, I thought maybe your site was a scam when I started looking at it thoroughly after placing my order and believed I may be getting strung along.  There are many scam sites out there and not having a customer service phone is a great drawback.I am a owner of multiple businesses and believe you have to have the entire package to be successful.  If you go into a fabulous restaurant that has the most incredible food, but the lighting is bad, music sucks, service pretentious, bad or whatever, then it is an overall poor experience.  The chef may be the best in the world but the restaurant fails.  I must say, your product is amazing and the price point very good and I’m very satisfied with that.  Your communication was good, but the 24 hour response did not help my fears Interior Icons was some sort of scam.

Casey,US,"Updated Jul 18, 2023Verified","What A Terrible Experience We've Had!!I cannot begin to tell you how absolutely AWEFUL our experience has been ordering through Interior Icons.  First off, you they do not list a number for you to call, so the ONLY way to communicate with this company is via email, which is crazy.  When communicating via email, they seem to care less about the customer and their individual experience.  We've repeatedly requested our money back and just to move on, however, Interior Icons has refused this time and time again.  Here is a little bit about our overall experience.  Even though it may appear to be a great value and exactly what you're looking for, I would urge you to STAY CLEAR of this company, as they are a complete sham...We ordered a table, which said ""Available For Shipment"" on November 2nd, 2022.  We only ordered it because we wanted to have it prior to Thanksgiving.  HOWEVER, this is how they get you.  We kept following up on the table, but apparently it wasn't even available, so here we are waiting for the table, which did not end up arriving until the next year.  Once it did arrive, the delivery company they are contracted with did not have any supplies necessary to deliver the table.  We literally had to provide them with gloves, sheets to protect our wood flooring, screwdrivers to open the box the tulip table came in, etc.. They then drug the heavy box(marble top) into our home and made a large approximately 15' gash in our wood flooring.  The delivery people were very nice and they are taking care of that damage, however, we cannot say the same for Interior Icons.  Once the delivery guys opened the box, the top was cracked all of the way through, so here we are again waiting for this darn table.  After COUNTLESS emails to this same person(Emma, if he/she even exists), we received notification that the base is shipping, BUT they still don't know when the top will be available.  They literally wanted us to accept deliver of half of what we ordered and then just store it in our home on their behalf, which we refused to do and requested that they ship the order in full, which makes sense.  During this entire time and the absolutely awful experience we've had with this order, we've requested time and time again to just cancel the entire thing and move on.  However, Interior Icons has refused to do this and they are shoving this order down our throats.  They then said that we could return it(once it came in), but we'd only get 80 percent of the amount back in return.  My wife when receiving a call form the delivery company, refused the order and had the items sent back to Interior Icons. However, they are now saying that since we didn't accept the delivery, we are now only getting 50 percent back. TRULY UNBELIEVABLE!  Please I beg this of you, pay the additional money to find a QUALITY company to purchase from, one that truly cares about the customer and their experience.  We are easy people to work with, and this is BY FAR the worst experience we've ever had.  IF we could get someone on the phone(WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO), I believe we could then work this out.  However, they hide behind their email and quick responses referencing ""terms"" that nobody ever reads. Just crazy..... STAY CLEAR OF INTERIOR ICONSDate of experience: November 01, 2022",1,Home
Kate Jackson Group,US,"Updated Jul 17, 2023","Absolutely TERRIBLE Experience!!!Absolutely HORRIBLE experience!  Prior to submitting a formal review, we've attempted everything possible to have our issues with our order resolved, however here we still are nine moths later.  We ordered a dining room table on November 2, 2022, when it finally was delivered months later, the delivery company they hired didn't have the proper tools and equipment to deliver the dining room table we had ordered. We had to provide them with the tools necessary(gloves, moving towels to protect floor, screwdrivers etc.), and upon bringing it into the home the delivery company scratched our entry wood floors running from our front door to our Dining Room, leaving a mark of approximately 15 feet in length. Upon opening the shipment, the table was damaged, so back again to waiting for another table to arrive.  They requested that we take shipment of the base only, but would then need to wait on the actual top since it was still unavailable.  What?!?  They then told us that if we were to refuse shipment, we would be charged a 20 percent re-stocking fee.  Upon refusing the shipment, we then receive another email stating that per the terms, we could see up to a 50 percent restocking fee.  Truly unbelievable, to say the least.  We have requested time and time again to have our money fully refunded, which is the right thing to do, considering the experience we've had.  Interior Icons can research all the email history for this. Absolutely awful, I can't say enough bad things about how this overall experience was ordering through interior icons.

The ONLY way to reach you guys is via email, which typically offers absolutely ZERO help.  Interior Icons hides behind the ""terms listed on their website"", however, you all use this in a way to completely take advantage of a customer.  Since the original shipment was damaged and the delivery company did major damage to the wood floors in our home, we  have requested time and time again to just cancel the darn order and move on.  However, you have refused to do this.  Since we refused the order, the shipment company sent those items back you, which you now have in your possession.  You are now saying since we did not accept the delivery and then use your ""portal"" to submit a return, we're now getting back 30 percent less that we would have if we had accepted the deliver.  This is absolutely CRAZY!  TO ANY POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS OF INTERIOR ICONS, EVEN THOUGH IT MAY APPEAR TO GREAT VALUE, IT IS NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE DEALING WITH THIS COMPANY.  UNLIKE A QUALITY COMPANY THAT DOES RIGHT BY THE CUSTOMER, THESE PEOPLE ARE A COMPLETE SHAM AND I WOULD ABSOLUTELY STEER CLEAR OF THEM.  WE ARE EASY PEOPLE TO WORK WITH, HOWEVER, THIS HAS BEEN THE ABSOLUTE WORST EXPERIENCE WE'VE EVER HAD ORDERING SOMETHING.  Also, for reference, here is the email we received so that I am above board.... Thank you for your emails.  Our returns fee only applies to return requests that have been made through our portal.  As you rejected the shipment, and did not submit a return request, we cannot honor a return fee, as the order is not classified as a return.  As advised previously and outlined in the terms and conditions of sale (which were agreed to at the time of purchase, ""In the event of a rejected delivery, Interior Icons will take responsibility for the return of the items, and a 50% restocking fee will be deducted from the refund processed. Please note that shipping charges are not able to be refunded once these services have been provided by our delivery partners.)"" Checking the box stating ""I agree with the terms and conditions"" at the time of purchase is deemed as you reading, understanding and accepting the full terms and conditions. As such, we cannot waive this fee.  Please let us know if you have any further questions and we will be happy to assist you.

Jude M,US,"Jul 9, 2023","Repeat buyer, always great qualityI love what your company offers, and have had great success with all my purchases.  Communication of purchase confirmation, shipping timeline and packing have all been excellent.  I even got the big arc lamp, and it was sent in two parts with understandable directions and packed well.   I do want to ask a question.  I had to pay shipping on my last purchase of the grasshopper lamp (I bought in stone) and was waiting for the July 4 sale to buy!  We are moving so money a little tight at the moment.  I went ahead and paid but it ate up the discount.  I haven’t yet received the lamp so wondered if the fee could be waived.

I ordered a pillow, works well, but the cover started unraveling after two days of use.  I took photos and emailed to customer support.  Resent the photos a few days later after not getting a response.  I then called customer service.  I spoke with Dana who could not find my emails.  I resent them again while she was on the phone, still not received.  I resent again using another email, still not received.  I checked, all the emails were delivered.  I finally requested another cover and suggested that I would return the damaged cover.  I was told no, their policy is that once the product is removed from the package it is my responsibility.  I then asked to speak with Dana’s supervisor.  I was put on hold then told the supervisor is busy and would call me back at a later time.  When I complained I was cut off.

After submitting additional information to Klaudena as requested via Trustpilot, we received a phone call from a very nice woman who told us they were going to refund our total purchase price (which they did) and we also did not need to return the cushions. We were very pleased. I think it’s a shame, however, that they can’t just create a fair and easy return policy. I’m sure the cushions work great for many people but if they don’t work for some people, those people shouldn’t be penalized. We ordered the cushions - 1 for each recliner and 1 for my mother’s wheelchair, plus a back rest and extra cover. They all arrived and I unpacked them. My mom found them to be very uncomfortable in both the recliner and wheelchair and felt they were too hard (she’s 89) and I didn’t like the feel of mine in the recliner. I realized there were no return instructions in the shipment so I called the company. At first I was told I couldn’t return them because I had opened them. How else could we know if we liked them? I said I would be contacting the Better Business Bureau and they rep put me on hold then said she would send a return authorization form. That’s when I found out I would have to pay to ship them to Germany. As others have mentioned the cost to ship to Germany is hardly worth it. I’m sorry I got involved with this company. Telling people you have a 30 day return policy and then making it virtually impossible to return is just wrong. Date of experience: December 07, 2024",1,Home

Like others (see negative reviews) I wanted to order one cushion but ""somehow"" my order stated 4 cushions after I paid. I realized that I hadn't ordered four cushions and I called the company IMMEDIATELY.  A very nice female answered my call and promised that that my order for four cushions would be cancelled.  A few hours later I received an email stating that once my order is placed, that I can't cancel.  I chose to try and reverse the procedure through PayPal but apparently that was not a proper channel for redress.  Klaudena told me that I would have to return the products at my expense with a tracking number (expensive as these cushions were heavy) and that there would be an additional restocking fee. Since this same thing has happened to others, there is no doubt that this company scams customers.

Now in her older age she was hoping this pillow would offer some relief while in her wheelchair. She was so excited when it arrived and couldn't wait to try it. She let it regain its shape from the packaging after 48 hours she finally tried it out and after 5 minutes of sitting on it she knew it wasn't what she hoped for. She tried to return it but proved to difficult to figure out so she asked me to figure it out. After sending out an email that never received a response other than an automated one I called the hotline. Well that was a total joke as they told me they would not accept a return since the package was opened. I of course asked to speak to a supervisor after being put on hold for 10 minutes I was told they would call me of course I never received a call back.

Judy Dughman,US,"Updated Nov 20, 2024","Buyer Beware! You cannot open this product or you can't return it.I bought two seat cushions from Klaudena, and although they are rather high (thick)\, I found them to be what I needed.  I decided to buy a back pillow for my office chair and after putting it on the chair, I realized it wouldn't work at all.  Klaudena says they except returns, but much to my surprise, they do not allow returns on any opened merchandise!  This back pillow, as well as the seat cushions, came rolled up and sealed in plastic.  So, I ask you, how are you to know if it will work or not if you can't open it to see??  Kllaudena gives no explanation, just repeats their rather vague, unclear policy, which, BTW, they don't fully detail when they say they accept returns.  Try to return it, then they mention it.  After a lot of communication with them, they absolutely refused to allow a return even though the product was NOT used, only opened.  I told them I would write this review so other people would be aware of this policy, to which they recited the policy again!  It became clear to me that obviously they don't care if you like the product, they just want their money!  Now, I'm waiting for it to fall apart in a few months.Update:  After more communication, the company refused to accept the return, but did refund me for the purchase of the back pillow. Unfortunately, I still believe they need to change their policy to allow returns on opened products as long as they are not used.  I repeat, how do you know if it will work if you can't open it?  It's rolled when you receive it, so you have to open it to lay it flat and try it.  Date of experience: October 08, 2024",1,Home

I went to express pay to complete the order and as soon as I logged into my Pay Pal account to set up payment, it immediately charged my account took it out of my balance, which isn't default and charged me for 4 cushions and 4 covers at a cost of $142.00.It didn't send me back to the company to verify the order, which it always does, i don't know how that happens.I immediately went to PayPal to try to stop the payment, but couldn't find a way to do that, so i filed a claim immediately.Then I called this company, all within an hour of ordering and tried to cancel the order and was told it had already been processed and they couldn't stop it, But they would put in a request to do so.12 hours later i went through the same thing with a different customer service rep, told her the story and she said the same thing. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that they would call me right back, they never did. 8 hours later I got a shipping notification, I was livid!Failure to respond to any of my requests or to cancel the order. I sent three emails telling them what happened, they emailed me and told me to just return the product for a full refund but return postage was at my expense. Take a guess where I had to return the package to, GERMANY!! At a cost of $98.25!! THIS COMPANY IS A COMPLETE JOKE, no customer service and they will steal your money if you are not satisfied. It will take a month to possibly get a refund and it is so expensive and  you are taking a chance at ever getting that refund. I'm 69 years old and have never had a company that has been this lousy to deal with. Avoid ordering from them at all costs. You are going to get screwed if you try to return anything, I'd give them 0 stars, they don't deserve 1.Update to earlier review:It is now December 15th,Joan Torres sent me this nice response to my earlier review saying that she wanted to work this out to my satisfaction. I have received no further communications from this company. I provided my order number, name, email address and phone number as requested. Nothing, zero response, I have talked to three different customer service representatives who have all stated that they would get back to me within 24 to 48 hours. No one has ever called or emailed me. I'm still stuck with four pillows and four covers that have never been opened.My next attempt at satisfaction is disputing the charge with the credit card company. I will do that tomorrow Dec 16th, it's been over a month with zero attempt to fix this  I really hope I can keep as many customers as possible from purchasing from this company.

Elaine Cooper,US,"Updated Jun 11, 2024","Purchase of Seat Cushions from Klaudena Co.I placed an order on May 11, 2024 through PayPal for seat cushions.  Normally, PayPay sends me back to the merchant to review the order and place it.  This didn't happen.  The order was placed immediately with no change to review or cancel it.  I contacted the company by email the same day to cancel the order  The response was that their orders are processed in a state-of-the art warehouse and changes can't be made to an order.  The state-of-the art warehouse did a very bad job of packing and shipping, and I received the box in very poor shape.  I took it to the post office to refuse it, and they delivered it again the next day stating that I had opened it, which I hadn't even though it looked like it.  I contacted Klaudena by email to return the order.  They sent me a Return Authorization, to ship it to Lithuania, and I would have to pay the shipping!  That amounts to almost as much as I was charged for the order, plus dealing with customs.  I have just had back surgery and was unable to take it and mail it, and stand in line at the post office to fill out customs papers.  I contacted them again on May 19 asking if there was a way to return it to the address it was shipped from in the US, but didn't hear from them until May 25.  They again said the only way is to ship it to Lithuania and pay the shipping costs.I looked on line and saw that others have had the same experience.  I even looked up the shipping address in Lithuania and there was a scam alert connected to the address I was given.  I then made a complaint to the Better Business Bureau and saw that others have done that also.June 10, 2024I am updating the above review.  I received a response from a representative of Klaudena.

Anita ,CA,"Updated Jun 6, 2024","SCAM indeed (I order 1, they charged and change order to 4)On June 5th 2024, Klaudena posted below that they have resolved the issue.  This is a lie.  They promised a refund for my inconvenience for many weeks.  They have even emailed a bogus invoice of refund to show a refund was made, which has not been received.  I feel like they want to do better, but they just cannot help themselves with the ongoing scam and deceit.  After many emails, I emailed a response to theirs for the last time.  I gave them 24 hours to actually make good on their word to refund or I would again update my review.  As promised, this is my experience. No refund and NO resolution.  My review below stands. Original review below this line_____________________________________________SCAM indeed.  Order #2y8nlp8.  Too bad as the product is good and really they don't need to do this to move inventory.  Like so many people reviewing here, I ordered ONE pillow and they switched it to 4 pillows and billed for that amount.  Upon noticing this, I called and then backed up in writing.  The company responded in writing this: ""I apologize and understand that you have received excess items on your cart that you wish to modify.  Unfortunately, our warehouse has already sorted everything out and won't be able to make any adjustments at this point. But hey, don't worry! (...insert upsell here).....And just so you know, we've got your back with our 30-day return policy. So, if you're not completely satisfied, returning the items is a breeze.""                                                             Well, 2 submissions on their website and 7 emails over the following weeks later to get the RMA (Return Merchandise Authorisation [notice their spelling error]) and it's crickets on their end.  They have their $ and one can't return without this form.  Nothing further from ""it's a breeze"" could be the truth.  Unless you are prepared to have 4 cushions, I'd say steer clear.  Also, they get away with this as the credit card company needs proof of ordering ""1"" but when company emails you your order, it's already edited to 4, thus you have no proof or recourse and they know it.  This is how they continue to get away with the scam.  Klaudena you could be much better than this but you take the low road instead.  Karma for Klaudena.  Date of experience: May 10, 2024",1,Home

Lisa Kay McCormick,US,"Updated May 22, 2024","Klaudena class action I'm in! ScamI read statements about a class action suit I'M IN!! Ordered 2 cushions 12/30/23 at 6:30 p.m. through PayPal. Went immediately to check PayPal to my horror shock $96.25 was charged for 4 just like many others on here. I got on the phone immediately couldn't get a hold of  person so I left 5 voicemail to cancel the entire order. All I got in reply was a we're busy sorry be patient type of generic email back many of them. First off that order was wrong charge me for 4 also they had it set up in PayPal for reoccurring charge WOW canceled it otherwise were going to take 96.25 each month.  After vm's & all the emails etc 5 days later they shipped it anyway. Made huge mistake I filed claim with Capital One I should have went through PayPal.  Now PayPal's told me they can't do anything cuz bank  decided against me & shocked bank simply ignored fact..I Refused Pkg!! Company has an option to leave voicemail what good if they're not listened to. No response from this company at all except 1 reply through PayPal. Did everything right as a consumer, effort I went through to try save me time them time to not even ship it. This BS inability to cancel orders was never relayed to me only found out after getting documents from the bank on how the bank came to their decision Capital One they decided AGAINST me & will be changing Banks!When I got the tracking number by email I immediately sent them a response stating that I was not going to accept the package I was going to refuse the package. To the bank statement made  I clicked a checkbox & agreed to terms and conditions and they don't accept cancellations WHAT total BS orders are canceled every day I've been dealing with online merchants over 20 yrs never heard those words uttered orders are changed and canceled every single minute it's just total BS.  After reading the reviews on here I believe it is a SCAM total scam they set you up! As a consumer I did everything right & immediately to cancel the entire order so it never would ship. As a consumer I have rights!!! who's bought through merchants for over 20 years and never anything like this scam Co. I have been going through it almost 6 months now made my health worse unacceptable. All I know I refused package I don't have their product won't stop until I get my money or some type of resolution. The end. The fact on their website never gave that information to the bank! FACT...it was returned to sender on January 12th and it was scanned by the USPS at 6:32 a.m. company stated I never gave proof WHAT? Their own damn website stated the proof in black and white return to sender! Thank God I got a screenshot! Forwarded it to the bank the bank doesn't care because Klaudena saying they didn't get the package back. Another issue is I came by the ad for the cushions on a pop-up and boy have I learned a valuable lesson .I will never buy again without reading reviews and never ever click on pop-ups I am on SSI major pain I've gone through several surgeries as well as cancer and thought I would try their damn cushion what a nightmare.  Totally believe it's a scam company must be doing  lousy & scam innocent consumers on quantity & get you by saying you checked the box & agreed.  Cost ship heavy items back is exactly why refused package They got order wrong not me. BS no cancellations terms & conditions don't mean SQUAT if they made the mistake on order! After reading reviews on here wow! Truth is it is scam on Qty & on purpose knowing that people can't afford to ship back. Total garbage scam.  Also made false statements to the bank straight up lies. Say they haven't got the package back I filed a missing package claim at USPS waiting to hear. Package shipped UPS surepost but USPS delivered it.  Got proof screenshot from their website wow really! Yes! In black and white return to sender & usps scanned on 1/12 6:32 am ""return to sender"" YES got it off their own website also forwarded it to the bank but bank doesn't care willing to give away my money steal it basically & give it to an online scam merchant knowing  I don't have their product they'll get product back & resell it total garbage Capital One is too will get new bank! Took Capital One from 1/6/24 til 3/15 to receive anything from them which is totally unacceptable I believe there's a legal timeline these things have to be addressed which am in the process of getting that information. After reading the reviews same exact thing happened to other people.  Assumed they duplicated that order but more SURE than ever total scam!! Talked to attorney took some advice but (I won't  stop to all exhausted) now I'm going straight to FTC, BBB consumer affairs agencies file claims.  Date of experience: December 30, 2023",1,Home

David J,AU,"Updated May 2, 2024","Initial issue resolved in a very satisfactory manner.THIS IS AN UPDATE. 3 MAY 2024.The company responded to my complaint. They refunded my credit card IN TOTAL. PLUS they let me keep the entire order. PLUS they sent me a gift as compensation for the issue... a nice Japanese knife. Yes, they initially did the wrong thing, but they took total ownership of the problem and fully compensated me. That is excellent. I will leave my original review below....When placing my order online on their website, I did not notice that the website defaulted to ordering FOUR seat back cushions. I only wanted ONE.As soon as I got the order confirmation I noticed my mistake.I contacted their Customer Support IMMEDIATELY and asked them to only send ONE seat back cushion and refund the difference to my credit card.That contact was made WITHIN MINUTES of me placing my order.THEY REFUSED.Now I have to wait until the four items are delivered to me and THEN return the three cushions that I do not need.That is terrible customer service.BUT IT GETS WORSE!!!Since originally posting this review, I began noticing similar reviews of Trust Pilot and Site Jabber where many many others have had the exact same problem. Some say that they definitely did not order FOUR but received FOUR even though they only ordered ONE. I am now wondering if that also happened to me. I am usually fairly astute and it is unlike me to make such a mistake.However, other reviewers in Australia (as I am) and in the USA are reporting that, although the product was sent from a warehouse in their country, Klaudena insist that the unwanted products are sent to LITHUANIA and the cost of postage is much higher than the cost of the actual product.That sounds like a deliberate SCAM to me. What do you think?BEWARE!!!REVIEW UPDATE 23 April 2024...I am not fooled by the platitudes expressed in Klaudena's reply below.I'm betting that the final ""result"" will be that I am asked to return the 3 extra products THAT I DO NOT NEED to LITHUANIA ... from Australia, even though the products are shipped FROM AUSTRALIA.THAT IS THE SCAM.It costs more to return the products than was charged for the products.PROVE ME WRONG KLAUDENA!Refund my credit card!Date of experience: April 20, 2024",5,Home

The postage costs are prohibitive and costs more than the price of the cushions/covers.  Raising this with them again I asked whether I could return them to NSW and was told they do not allow return to the distributor.  This means any purchase in Australia would not be returned due to this policy.  This is shameful.  A complaint to ACCC is forthcoming if there is not a suitable response to this matter.Following this review lodgment I was contacted by the Head of Customer care who arranged a refund and apologized for the issues and explained the company was still learning.

Dianna Bond,CA,"Mar 19, 2024","My name is DiannaMy name is Dianna, I was online and ordered some product, then changed my mind, so I contacted a live rep, at which time she said she would contact Klaudena and cancel it. A few days later I get an email saying the product was on its way. I responded back right away and told them that I had cancelled it, to stop the order.  I get yet another responce back saying that I have to wait for the product to come and then return it. By this time i'm frustrated, and since it came from a warehouse in Mississauga, send it back to Mississauga. $210.00 was charged to my credit card, $12.00 of it was from shipping from Mississauga. The first package arrived Feb.26th, the send arrived the 27th. It took me many days to find out if I return it back to Mississauga, at which time I was told yes, but last week am told to return it to Lithuania, which was confusing. When I went to the post office, it was going to cost me $198.00, so I would be out that, plus the order costing $210, i would only get a few dollars back. I got an email today stating that because I sent it back to Mississauga, which cost me $51.06 when I paid $12.00 from Mississauga, I'm now out $210.00 plus $51.06 and I sent the product back to warehouse it was sent from. I see by the reviews I'm not the only one being told no money back, and paying for purchase agains my credit card and no product for I sent it back to MIssissauga where it was shipped from.

I continually contacted the department before my order was sent so the order could have been stopped. To be told to be patient by the customer service officer, who was continually trying to sell me something else at a discounted price. My order was sent from Australia (which is where I am from and I should have been able to send it back to ) but it had to  be returned to Luithiana. Costing more in postage than the actual items. This is disgusting and a total rip off. After asking why can’t I send it back to where it was sent from (Australia ) to  be told basically ‘bad luck’… I sent numerous emails to the manager of the customer service team to have this issue resolved and refunded, to get the same response and ‘bad luck’ basically. It was not until this review that something was actually done and I did receive a refund, but it was extremely hard work. I  feel if your customer service manager responded to my emails differently, this could have all been avoided. If the customer service officer who received my first email five minutes after my order, phoned the company here in Australia to stop the order this could have all been avoided also. The cushions were actually sent from Australia and should be returned to the same place, instead of Lithuania. Costing a lot less in postage. This was wrong..

The wooden planks had some black smudges that can not be cleaned, they were negligently made, the veneer placement was askew, the holes for dowels had different diameters.After the assembly the whole cabinet was wobbly and the main planks were not parallel to eachother.The biggest dissappointment was the design of the back of the cabinet, made from three cardboard pieces, with two visible connections.

After about 1 week, I received the bench and the table, and a small inflatable boat, which I thought at first, was a ''bonus gift''. It was not, since I have received no chairs.It took me about a month of nagging with customer support, to tell them that they have sent the wrong item (PS: The customer support did barely understand what I was saying, probably using Google translate, and they have switched agents for almost every reply I got). After 1 month of emailing back and forth, they apparently understood the problem, and after a week, I finally received my package, only to find another bench inside, instead of the chairs. It then took another month to get them to understand what they did wrong, and only then, after 2 months and 30+ emails written, and an army of CS agents, they have finally sent me the right package.This experience has left me deeply dissatisfied with their service.+ the quality is bad, it doesn't match the price at all.Date of experience: May 25, 2023",1,Home

The bed comes with instructions that doesn't have correct display of what holes on the black wooden boards, that you get. They aren't numbered and look quite the same. So you can really relay on the instructions to put the boards together.So when you figure that out, you realise after 5 hours that actually you got the map of 1 bed and 1 additional piece, that makes the design pretty. So in any case you get a lot of extra parts.So if you started with the first map and assembled the whole bed, you have to reassemble everything again becouse that additional part comes instead of the pieces of first map, which remain at the end...Anyway, this seems like a joke and if it wouldn't be such a problem reasseblme that all and send back i would return it, becouse also the boards are not painted well, are damaged and a few of them are also a little too short...So maybe at lease give the costumers the accurate instructions with pictures that display everything as it should be.

Igor S,SI,"May 7, 2023","How can you send the same WRONG item 2 times in a row!I am absolutely enraged and deeply disappointed with the abysmal service I have received from VidaXL. Not only did they manage to send me the wrong item once, but they had the audacity to repeat the mistake for the second time on the same order! It is beyond comprehension how a company can exhibit such a staggering level of incompetence and carelessness.The sheer amount of time and effort wasted in dealing with VidaXL's consistent errors is mind-boggling. First, I had to spend precious time contacting their customer support, explaining the situation, and initiating a return. I thought this would be the end of my ordeal, but little did I know that VidaXL had other plans to test my patience.When I finally received the replacement item, my hopes were quickly dashed as it turned out to be yet another incorrect product. It is astonishing how a company can repeatedly fail at fulfilling a simple order, especially after they were made fully aware of the mistake they made previously.As a result of VidaXL's gross negligence, not only did I have to invest additional time and energy in returning the wrong items, but I also had to endure the disappointment and frustration of not receiving what I had initially ordered. The level of inconvenience and inconvenience caused is simply unforgivable.Furthermore, the fact that this happened twice for the same order is indicative of systemic flaws within VidaXL's operations. It raises serious questions about their quality control, attention to detail, and overall reliability as an online retailer. Customers should be able to trust that the products they order will be delivered correctly, without the need for repeated interventions and time-consuming returns.Needless to say, I will never be making another purchase from VidaXL, and I strongly caution others to steer clear of this company. Their inability to fulfill even the simplest of orders accurately and their blatant disregard for customer satisfaction are utterly unacceptable.In conclusion, VidaXL's consistent delivery of wrong items, not once but twice for the same order, has left me feeling frustrated, inconvenienced, and utterly dissatisfied. Their inability to rectify their mistakes and their lack of regard for their customers' time and trust is appalling. Save yourself the headache and avoid VidaXL at all costs.Date of experience: May 07, 2023",1,Home

I was informed about the delay, which I appreciated.The product was exactly what I ordered. I'm not sure how you produce them, but the craftsmanship was on point. I am a fairly skilled carpenter, so I recognize good work.Do not take this as negative criticism, but more as product development. One of our dogs has a black coat, with white accents. That clip art kind of got lost in a dark background. Maybe a thin white line around the clip art?

I accept that they're likely busy at Christmas, but it's super disappointing that I've had no response on shipping despite paying for an express service.Really concerned a family member will not get their Christmas present this year.Update: After seeing this review, I got the same ""We've sent you a message"" as others here, promising my parcel was on the way to the airport. Tracking shows that as untrue.They stated ""Delivered by 17th December"" when I ordered and paid for express delivery. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY.

I placed these so I would have them for Christmas,  for my loved ones after the recent passing of my Dad. I have sent multiple emails requesting a response regarding whether I will receive them in time...nothing. But I'm getting marketing emails. And no, nothing has gone to spam/junk folders. Not impressed at all. Spent well over $300, but at this point, I would not recommend at all!!The company seems to only respond when left negative reviews.  After my first review, I was told my orders would ship in 2-3 days, that has now come and gone. Nothing has shipped, they, again, do not respond to emails. I will be going to the Better Business Bureau and if I do not get a response by tomorrow (12 days after my orders were placed) I am going to my credit card company to reverse the $400 they charged me.

By 22/12/2024, when I found time to sit down and write an email, one of the brushes had 13 serious cracks in the casing. One is already letting the brush hairs come off. The contact email explained the issue, and I attached photos as proof. Two and a half weeks later (8 working days in the UK around the Christmas and NY holidays) I received an email asking me if I still needed assistance. When I replied with ""Yes"" they asked me to describe the issue and send photos, again. I did. The reply was that the brushes were not covered by warranty and, a quote, ""Depending on use, the brush heads may become damaged over time"". From product receipt to the time my missus noticed the cracks - about 3 weeks. She used the brush head twice. It did its job well though. They offered us a discount on a new brush head.

Isa,CA,"Dec 4, 2024","2stars for the bad advertising**2stars for the bad advertising**I bought this product because I thought the bathroom tile brush was interesting. After purchasing the product, I received a call on the same day informing me that my product only included two types of brushes and that if I wanted to clean the bathroom tiles, I would need to buy another brush. I was a bit frustrated. I asked them why it wasn't stated on the website when purchasing that I could choose different types of brushes; it feels a bit like false advertising. So, I finally bought the $25 brush for the bathroom tiles, but I was still somewhat frustrated. The next day, I received a second call offering me an extension for the handle for the same machine. Seriously, it feels like harassment regarding the purchase. Why not include everything or highlight the choices when buying the product so that we know that not everything is included, rather than being harassed by phone? I also told the second person who called me that it was the second time, and she started to argue with me, saying it wasn’t her fault the first time. I said no, I understand it's not you, but your calls are starting to feel harassing. This company does not inspire confidence. I feel like it’s starting to resemble a scam. I'm looking forward to receiving the product to see if it’s of quality, but for now, I have my doubts.Date of experience: December 02, 2024",2,Home

Kai Chow,AU,"Dec 3, 2024","REGRET BUYING Hurts and stresses the wrist, due to the location of its grip and the item's head. Either top grip or gripless would make it easier to apply additional pressure if necessary. Apparently, applying pressure from the side grip makes it harder, and pressure on the wrist. The bigger the brush increases the wrist strain. Good for flat surfaces only, otherwise don't buy. I am a regular cleaner and I won't recommend it. A terrible DESIGN and pretty useless.PS. My review is based on the effectiveness and efficiency of the item, not the understanding of use, quick delivery, or ease of payment of the item.Date of experience: November 27, 2024",1,Home

Jayden Mudge,NZ,"Dec 1, 2024","Good for scrubbing flat surfaces, nothing elseThe number of use cases for this product is far smaller than the ads suggest. The motor isn't very powerful, so its scrubbing power is only enough to remove gentle layers of dirt. The rigid structure of the device means it's not great at cleaning in corners and crevices, so only really helps on lightly soiled flat services. The soft sponge head is the worst offender, the adhesive disintegrates with use of ""harsh chemicals"", dishwashing detergent is fine, but I can't use my all purpose surface cleaner with it. Even so, I find using a regular sponge by hand faster, easier, and more effective. The main use case I have found for my Synoshi is scrubbing up soap scum with the brush head. Good for in the bath and sink, everything else it's a downgrade from cleaning things manually.Date of experience: December 01, 2024",2,Home

It barely holds itself together, the door does not close properly, there are gaps. There is a roof ventillation window that also cannot function properly, because the holes in the pre-fabricated frame are wrongly drilled, so you cannot brace open the window. Even during mild winds, the plastic walls fall out or just straight up bend. The product picture on the site was also misleading, because it did not show how the walls are actually mounuted on the frame (they give you something that resembles of clamps that you put between the plastic wall and the frame to fix it in place). Less after 1 month, the greenhouse shows sign of corrosion inside/outside.I'm really dissapointed/angry with this purchase.This was a rather expensive greenhouse, so I was expecting quality materials not being scammed.This was my last time ordering anything from this company and I advise everyone not to buy from this site.Shame on you vidaxl.Date of experience: September 20, 2024",1,Home

In my account read: ""For technical reasons, we were unable to properly handle your request at this time. We apologize for any inconvenience caused."" The table top in question came in 3 pieces, and its quality goes far beyond the rustic adjective.

Gergő Péter Vaszilkó,HU,"Oct 23, 2024","Incorrect support informationDue to incorrect support information, I have suffered financial damage. Based on the details available on the website, I could not determine the required installation width for a small garden gate. I contacted customer support for clarification, and based on the provided information, I instructed the professionals installing the concrete fence to place the posts 105 cm apart. I coordinated the order of the product and the installation of the posts to ensure my yard would not remain open. As a result, the posts were installed before the product arrived. However, after assembling the gate, I discovered that the installation width is not 105 cm, as indicated by the support team, but rather 109-111 cm. There is no similar product available on the market that fits a 105 cm width, which means I now have to have one custom-made at a significantly higher cost, as the posts are already in place, and my yard has been open for several days or weeks.Date of experience: October 14, 2024",1,Home

A termék ettől nem lett jobb, de úgy látszik a webshop törődik a vevőivel, így 3 csillagra módosítok az 1-ről.I was contacted by customer service, they were nice and helpful, they are compensating me for the problem. This did not make the product better, but it seems that the webshop cares about its customers, so I am changing it from 1 to 3 stars.----------A rendelés egyszerű, a kiszállítás gyors, az ügyfélszolgálat segítőkész, de a termék amit kaptam, kritikán aluli összeszerelhetőség és kivitelezés szempontjából. Az ágykeret egyes elemei igénytelenül voltak gyalulva, lefestve, az összeszerelést segítő furatok nem illeszkedtek megfelelően, kínszenvedés volt összerakni, egy léc pedig még a teljes összecsavarás előtt megrepedt. Csak azért nem küldtem vissza, mert nem lett volna megoldható számomra a logisztika. Abban maradtunk magunkkal, hogy a nyaralóba ""jól van az úgy"", és innen többet nem rendelünk.The order is easy, the delivery is fast, the customer service is helpful, but the product I received is below criticism in terms of assembly and construction. Some elements of the bed frame were undemandingly planed and painted, the holes for assembly did not fit properly, it was a pain to put together, and one slat cracked before it was completely screwed together. The only reason I didn't send it back was because the logistics couldn't have been solved for me. We decided it will be ""good as it is"" for our holiday home and we will not order from here again.Date of experience: December 21, 2023",3,Home

Kim,HU,"Jan 11, 2024","well, this time in English...(Although I already wrote a review at an other place, but if the automatic system wants it, I dot it here also. This time in English.) I haven't ordered big value products in the past, so I don't remember the last few occasions. They probably had a good average performance, because I tend to note the standouts.This time I ordered a higher value item (a DIY table or sg. like that) before Christmas.The good experience:- fast delivery- they responded quickly (despite the holidays)- They didn't want to deny the failures (but it has to be noted, that I sent detailed photo documentation about the defects)- customer service write very often sorry.And that's it.The bad side:- Their chat interface didn't work. At all. (I tried more than once or twice...)- I was forced to go to the ""ask for call back"" page - but they later contacted me in emal- in a machine-translated letter, which is confusing in my native language (the machine translation still does not work well in my mother tongue....)- although I asked if we should switch to English, in order to avoid uncertanties, they left me with no specific response to that, and continued with the machine translation- despite the multiple, documented error lists, I asked for just one thing: send me a spare part of the item, (which part I really could not repair), so that I can reliably use all the functions of the product. This was refused.- the fault was not disputed, but they offer a refund which does not commensurate with the faults (something around 20% of the original price - for an item, that arrived broken despite the outer packaging being approximately intact, and does not look like as shown in the ad, and generally saying, it has a very poor quality)(Also has to be noted, that they offered a free return with a replacement, too, but at one hand, it was a gift, I wouldn't have had much use of it months later, on the other hand, I wasn't convinced that if they were sending an other piece from this, it would be any better, and, in addition to that, I simply didn't have time to get on the ""return-shipment-waiting for the courier"" train. So it wasn't viable option. )On this basis, I wouldn't recommend them, although I have indeed had worse customer complaint handling - but it is already quite wrong, when someone has to tuckle with customer complaint about a faulty product, from just right at the moment of unpacking...Date of experience: December 20, 2023",2,Home

The 4 sponges and 2 pillows made of net-like waste material, which are also low quality, can be compressed with two fingers to a thickness of 1 mm. I had to cause to do new ones for HUF 50,000.

David,US,"May 12, 2023","Beware of ""No Refund"" Scam by Online StoresPurchased over $1000 of light fixtures from Online Stores Light Up website.  They were installed in two days.  Some of the fixtures started malfunctioning almost immediately and Online Stores was contacted.  After several weeks all the fixtures were malfunctioning.  During this time I was in contact with Online Stores and wasn't offered a single solution, except that the manufacturer was looking into the problem.  Online Stores inaction shut my jobsite down for three weeks and prevented a retail store from opening.  I eventually had to purchase all new fixtures and replaced them at my own expense under threat of lawsuit from the owner and general contractor.  I directly asked Online Stores in email if they wanted the faulty fixtures returned or I would throw them into the trash, as they were large 2x4 light fixtures and the packaging had been thrown out.  They responded that they would provide a refund.  No mention of returning the fixtures even after I stated they would be thrown out.  They then stated that the fixtures had a manufacturers defect and that they had already received a credit for them from the manufacturer.  Online Stores faulty fixtures were replaced and thrown into a jobsite dumpster. They never refunded anything.  Two months later my Paypal claim was denied because Online Stores told them I was still in possession of the light fixtures that were thrown out.  They are now refusing a refund stating I have to return the light fixtures.  No refund after I asked them if the fixtures needed to be returned.  No refund after they are on record admitting the fixtures were defective.  No refund after they admitted they had received a credit from the manufacturer.Date of experience: February 09, 2023",1,Home

Victoria,US,3 days ago,"Potential disaster diverted with our Prepared Hero ClothI purchased Prepared Hero for each of our daughter’s families for Christmas a year ago. Of course I got one for our home as well.While a son-in-law (contractor) was replacing a microwave above our gas stove, our daughter was helping. To keep any debris from getting into the cracks and crevices of our stove top we covered it with a handy dandy drop cloth.Very soon after the work began we all smelled gas!! Our daughter got off the stove top, where she had been “laying” to help with said microwave. There was a small hole in the drop cloth that was being burned. Obviously we had bumped the burner knob which turned on & we had a little fire. Little because I immediately grabbed my Prepared Hero cloth which did what it was created to do.

So I felt a little safer in my house.But while walking in the park a man confronted me about of all things the hat I was wearing.It belonged to my late husband and I just like to wear it. it was for a sports team that is not the local club.This man was angry and called me something terrible. I was legitimately afraid of him.I was able to walk away because the park was fairly crowded. But I started thinking about how often I’m hiking in a more isolated area. I have a dog but she’s fairly passive. So I began carrying both pepper spray and a large pocket knife.I felt a little better but then I considered what would happen if those were to be taken from me. And also whether I would actually be able to hurt another person even under duress since I’ve never trained for that.So now I carry the defense alarm.I’m now confident I can at least startle a person with bad intentions and hopefully get some help.I’m not going to give up walking in parks.I am going to take reasonable steps to keep myself safe.I ordered some for my sisters and friends as well.Date of experience: November 26, 2024",5,Home

Kelcey S,US,7 days ago,"16 days order says still preparing for shipment…unable to contact prepared hero…might be scamAfter a small kitchen fire during a Christmas party on Dec 20. I placed an order for a 4 pack and then added a 2 pack of the fire blankets at checkout on 12/21/24, a total of 6 blankets to be prepared in the future and give as gifts to family. I received the 2 pack shipped via  amazon on 12/24 that I added to my original order at check out. I have yet to receive the 2nd part to my order of the 4 pack of blankets.  When I go to pull up my order confirmation the 4 pack of emergency fire blankets still says preparing for shipping. Very frustrating that it has been now 16 days and I haven’t received my order or an update. I have reached out to the email listed(which I keep getting message saying undeliverable, so that doesn’t work), the phone number listed to contact (but just keep getting a recording that says high volume of calls so to email the same email that hasn’t been working and then call says, goodbye and hangs up), messaged them on Instagram and Facebook with same message to email support@preparedhero  that doesn’t work and I also messaged on contact form on website and no one has responded.  So they charged me for 6 blankets, they’ve been paid for but 4 have not shipped yet. I would think it was a total scam if I hadn’t received 2 blankets quickly.  Customer service is horrible and communication with company impossible. I was excited to have and recommend your blanket but I am changing my mind.

I ended up calling my bank and cancelled the order, since I couldn't get a response from the company. Finally, I hear from them that they cancelled the order due to a dispute from my bank.

We’ll assist with your return, which typically takes 2-3 weeks.To qualify for a refund, your item must be unused, in its original packaging, and in the same condition as received. Please note that you’ll need to cover the return shipping cost.Once we receive your return, we’ll let you know if it’s approved. If so, the refund will be processed within 3-5 business days.But we’d love to offer some options to skip the hassle of returning it and add extra value for you! Let us know which one sounds best:Option 1 – Store Credit + No Return Needed (Best Value)We’ll issue a store credit for $50.00 that you can use on any future purchase. No need to send anything back, and your credit will be valid for 2 years. Plus, you get to keep the product!Option 2 – Keep the Item + DiscountGet an immediate refund of $40.00 and keep the item. You save time and enjoy a great discount on the product!Option 3 – Full Refund Upon ReturnOf course, if neither option suits you, we’re happy to process a full refund once we receive and approve your item.Please let us know which option works for you, and we’ll take it from there! We’re here to make this easy and ensure you have a great experience with us.--Thank you for Preparing to be a Hero!The above is what I received from Prepared Hero, but only after posting my dissatisfaction on Trust Pilot. I find their approach to dealing with requests for refunds are the tactics of an unethical company by offering 40% of the purchase price for you to go away, not their 30 day money back guarantee on their website. I replied to their email offering $40 and to keep the two pens, one that won’t charge the battery and the other one that must be within an inch to detect the signal of a cell phone.

WessMcD,US,"Dec 31, 2024","Missing in Action… Order and Support On Dec 10th I placed an order for 12 Prepared Hero blankets to give as Christmas gifts for several family members. The cutoff date for ordering in time for Christmas delivery was Dec 12th according to their website, which I chose to order from directly instead of ordering through Amazon. I thought it would be a kind jester to the company to order direct and cut out the middle man. Upon ordering I received a confirmation email stating I would receive shipping information soon. After a week of no updates, I emailed the support team asking for an update and immediately received an automated response stating not to worry that my order was being processed and that all orders placed before 12/12 we’re guaranteed to arrive before Christmas. To date (12/30/24), no additional updates have been provided and the order has still not arrived, despite daily emails sent to their support line asking for order status. Today I received an email from Prepared Hero asking for a review, so I’m hoping that sharing my disappointing and frustrating experience will invoke a response from the company and let me know when I can expect to receive my very late order and be able to give my very late gifts to those I love.Date of experience: December 30, 2024",1,Home
Barbara Ducharme,US,Updated 2 days ago,"Disappointed but still hopeful.UPDATE:  MY PACKAGE FINALLY ARRIVED!!  I feel that it's only fair that I now respond on a more positive note.  My fear that this was a scam has been put to rest.  Although the package arrived two weeks after Christmas (delivery had been guaranteed by December 24) I can now provide my family with a gift that I hope they will never have to use.  My only suggestion to Prepared Hero is that you provide updates when shipments will be delayed. Responses to my multiple emails would have been appreciated.ADDITIONAL COMMENT:Regarding the response from Prepared Hero...I have NOT heard from any of your customer service agents. I have sent 2 separate emails and have not received an answer to either one.  Could you please include his/her response here?  All I'm looking for is the date that my order will be shipped and when I will receive it.Like some other reviews I've seen here, I'm starting to fear that this is a scam.  I ordered 12 fire blankets on December 12 and immediately received a confirmation email with an order number.  These were intended to be Christmas gifts for my entire family.  I knew I was cutting it close but was still hopeful.  I tried calling Prepared Hero on December 20.  A recorded message said they were experiencing heavy call volume and that I might receive a quicker response by email.  No option to stay on hold.  The end of the message also said ""we guarantee delivery by December 24 for all orders sent by December 16"". I sent an email but received no answer. Christmas came and went....no gifts for my family.  I sent a second email yesterday and I'm anxiously awaiting a response.Another reason that I'm suspicious is that MY CREDIT CARD WAS CHARGED ON THE DAY OF THE ORDER!  I try to be understanding of the pressure that retailers face during the holidays but I don't think a response is too much to ask.Date of experience: December 10, 2024",1,Home

Eileen D.,US,"Dec 23, 2024","Ordered 8 Fire Blankets/Rec'd 4 - Customer Service came to the RescueI recently ordered 8 Fire Blankets from Prepared Hero. The order was shipped out quickly but upon receipt, there were only 4 Fire Blankets in the box.  I first tried to call the company but there was a problem getting through on the number listed in their advertisement (this made me a little worried). I then found an email address and proceeded to write to them.   I'll admit, when I did not see a reply email from them the next day, I started to wonder if this was all a scam. Not being too tech savvy, I had forgotten that sometimes emails land in the Spam file by accident.  The next day I checked my Spam file and sure enough, there was the reply that they had sent to me the day before.  They apologized for any problem that I was having. They asked if I could send them photos of the labels on my package and take a photo of how they were packaged in the box. I did everything they asked of me, and sent the email back. The very next day they contacted me saying they were very sorry this had happened and they would send out my additional Fire Blankets right away. Wow, that was painless. I mean, I was hoping they weren't going to give me a hard time, as I really couldn't ""prove"" that I only rec'd 4 of the 8 blankets ordered. A few days went by and I rec'd another email saying there might be a slight delay in my receiving my package due to the volume of orders they were currently processing. Understandable, I was happy they took the time to notify me of that.  I am pleased to announce that on Dec. 21st, I rec'd the other 4 Fire Blankets that they owed me.  I had read many reviews on this company before ordering and I will say, there were plenty of great reviews but there were also some that made me a little skeptical. So when I did not receive the amount of blankets that I ordered, I was priming for a fight.  However, that was not the case. I was very pleased with the way they handled my ""complaint"".  They were efficient and professional. I worked in customer service for 20 years so I know how things should go and how they could go.  In my case, Prepared Hero handled things the way they should be handled ... and I thank them for it. I will be gifting these to several family members during the Holidays, with hopes that they never need it!!!Date of experience: December 05, 2024",5,Home
