Also, when you click on a website when you are looking for information, many times it will not take you to the link that you clicked on. It just sits there. Trying to use their service has been frustrating. You have to send them emails when you have a problem, and they don't respond for 2-3 days.

No sooner than TotalAV got my account number, they tried to withdraw money two times and Bank of America of America send two alerts immediately declaring the transaction as fraud and cancelled my debit card. The Bank of America has one of the best fraud detectors in the US. TotalAV is a fraud. Do not stake your money, even a cent with this company.

Right now I dont have a phone. Last Saturday morning around 11:30 am my phone crashed again. The phone that I was using I purchased myself because the phone that I was charged for by QLink wireless is trash. The phone has never worked. This was the 2nd phone ordered from them because the 1st phone would not charge. I kept getting errors. On April18th 2024 I contacted QLink wireless about the problem I was having and the gentelman that assisted me on the phone was down right nasty and rude. He accused me of trying to subsribe to another wireless phone company and all I was doing was contacting them to get information so I could keep the same number I have been using because of personal and family business. Presently I am using the phone they sent to me only for texting. The screen on the phone will not scroll up and down. Its hard to text and the volume is so low I have to use speaker phone to talk to my doctor or family members. You can never get these people on the phone, I have been calling for over 2 months and all I get is a recording saying how busy they are. If you leave a message no one will return your calls. This is the worst company I have ever in my life had to deal with. I would really like to subscribe to Assurance wireless again, I never had these kinds of problems with them.

As this company has NOT sent my new SIM card as of this date, and it's been over 20 days since I started this nightmare...The phone number just puts me into a continual loop, going through the AI message over and over again, I've tried to hit every selection and tried dozens of times to contact this company, with NO SUCCESS!!!The service thus far from ALL of these so-called services is a JOKE!!!If I ran a company like this, It would surely FAIL!!!You NEED a way for us to contact a HUMAN being as you haven't a clue on how to program your AI, in fact you can't ever set up your phone service to work properly...If this isn't fixed ASAP, there will be consequences...Date of experience: November 01, 2024",1,Electronics

Elizabeth Hardy,US,"Updated Nov 23, 2024","No help!! 🥵I had service with them for 2 yrs. When I get a notice stating thatmy service was going to be disconnected. Because of company members doing illegal things. So they were charged with by the FBI. And to find another provider by a certain date you would no longer have service. Also I was received a text saying if I didn't get a new sim card or the e sim that or my service would no longer work. And my service stopped working & my Daughter has the same service but her phone was still working. Then because I'd applied to another company. My service was cut off but because my Daughter's was working & I'd still not received a sim. I reapplied but even though I was approved my service wouldn't work! So I called customer service witch is a joke. No one wants to do there job & figure out the problem & every person you speak to has another reason why I don't have service. So after a week & a half & having to reapply for the second time. You have to wait hrs sometimes to speak to someone. And sending a message on the app u never get anything fixed. And u have to wait a hour to get someone it's ridiculous!! There is no coverage at all in rural areas & when you live in it. If I could find better coverage!!I'd be done with this mess!!

kondapalli abhinav,IN,18 hours ago,"I bought an Apple Watch Series 7 from…I bought an Apple Watch Series 7 from Reebelo, after looking at the reviews overall. It doesn’t charge properly and clearly has a faulty battery. The battery drains from 100% to 1% within minutes and, even worse, shows as 100% charged in just a minute. It overheats constantly, making it unusable. All this happens while the Battery Health still shows Maximum Capacity at 100%—which is absurd. This is unacceptable for a so-called ‘premium product’ from Reebelo, sold as ‘as good as new.’ It’s a dummy watch with either a fake or damaged battery.

They sell refurbished stock with aftermarket parts, basically taking broken items and making them run long enough for you to be happy, initially, but these items are problematic because they don't have manufacturer parts and are likely to fail or not run properly. Additionally, they also sell scam warranties that are just cheap enough that you pay them for a sense or reassurance, but these warranties are borderline scams, you will be without an item and will never get your money back. They painfully gaslight you with nice emails and gaslight you as they purposefully misconstrue your emails.  I mean just read the bad reviews here! ACCC, more of us need to notify the ACCC.

Carolyn Sinclair,GB,3 days ago,"AVOID! DO NOT USE - CAVEAT EMPTOR! I ordered a reconditioned 2017 iMac in early November 2024. The first one when delivered, the monitor was completely smashed. It was replaced while we were interstate and delivered when we were absent. When we returned home on Christmas Eve , I was stricken with Covid and unable to open the replacement computer. When I opened the box, the second computer screen was also damaged. Reebelo then replied as I had not replied within the time period (even though that would have been Christmas Day) it was out of warranty and I would have to have it fixed myself. As I am living in the country, it is impossible for me to travel to an Apple Store to have the screen replaced.Date of experience: January 10, 2025",1,Electronics

Together with the phone I also bought a screen protector.1)Only the screen protector seemed to have a tracking ID on the 23rd. I don't think much of this and assume both items must then use the same package or parcel. 2)I also notice I used a wrong suburb code for my address when I shipped my order. Its too late to correct the address from rebeelo so I get in touch with the couriers; Aus post; with my one tracking ID.3)The aus post can be annoying to reach and be in touch with which I finally do on 07/01/2025 with valid info that my package was in lost and found warehouse but no way it had any kind of phone inside since it was a letter and the weight was too low.4)That confirmed my fear that the package/ parcel shipped out was just the screen protector! For 3 weeks now!5)So did my phone even get dispatched? Rebeelo got to my case and with their quick response I found out they had not posted my phone's tracking ID. Thats the only issue with them, they don't post tracking IDs of shipped out items separately. I think its a bug on their dashboard, 3 stars only because the customer care team responded to my emails promptly.

Skylar,CA,Updated 3 days ago,"Wrong phone came in, not first issueI’ve had some minor issues with receiving items of lesser quality than I ordered (with no compensation or notification of such, before or after the fact), but this last order was the last straw for me. I had to replace the last iphone I got from Reebelo because it shattered (my fault, not theirs), so I figured I’d replace it with another red iphone 12, but this time I got the battery upgrade. Two weeks go by, I realize it’s the day my shipping estimate showed, and my phone has NOT been shipped out. Reach out to customer service — turns out the estimated shipping date given at checkout is NOT an arrival date, it is an estimated DISPATCH date, and they were very cut and dry about informing me of such, as if I should have known when that isn’t made clear at all. Fast forward to today, about a week later. My phone arrives. I’m excited because I love hacing a red iphone and the one I am currently using had to be put in a skin case to keep the glass from falling off, meaning my phone was completely hidden. Immediately upon opening the box, something seems weird — there’s a screen protector and a bumper case that I didn’t order in the box on top of the phone box. Weird, but I’m not about to complain.Until I realize the next few things: the phone box itself was never taped or held shut in any way, and the bubble wrap was not very tight in the box. It ABSOLUTELY could have flown out at any time, but fortunately didn’t. The charge and SIM tray pin were both left in the box directly against the screen, which FORTUNATELY didn’t get scratched. And to top it all off: it’s not even the phone I ordered. Instead of the nice, red iphone 12 I ordered, I got a black one, which I suspect is why I got the screen protector and bumper case alongside it without being charged. I have yet to hear back from customer service, but I suspect the suggested fix will be to send the phone back and have a replacement shipped out. If I had any faith that that would take less than a month, I’d likely take the offer, but I can’t go more than another few days with a shattered phone, so I’m just going to have to suck it up and use it. Edit: After further inspection, I discovered that I also did not get the 100% battery capacity upgrade that I ordered and the phone case is for an iPhone 12 Pro Max — the phone is an iPhone 12, so it doesn’t even fit. No response from customer service as of yet in regards to any of this, either. Date of experience: January 09, 2025",3,Electronics

I bought an iPhone 11PRO on November 11, 2024 and didn’t receive it as promised. Customer service said they would look into it but they were taking a long time. I figured out from the invoice that it was coming from Texas. I found their phone number for the vendor and talked to someone in a warehouse who said they had sold the phone to someone else and initiated a credit which I received same day. I then ordered again from Reebelo an iPhone 12 Pro which came from vendor Cellfeee in NY. When downloading my data, the phone immediately overheated. Reebelo had me return it after clearing out all data and sent me a replacement from same vendor Cellfeee that immediately overheated as well and the phone stated battery was severely degraded. Reebelo wanted me to clear it out again and sent it back to them. This is all on my time to clear it out, pack it up and take it to UPS Store which is not nearby. I requested instead a refund for the battery replacement for $89. They refused. Cellfeee had offered $30 which I countered with $45 for half the cost. Now Cellfeee says it cannot do anything and that I have to return it to them to make a decision on the condition of the phone. They don’t care that the fault lies on their side. Customer Service sends out canned messages. I have decided to keep the phone and replace the battery at my cost.

My PayPal address is my old address, but my reebelo address is the correct one. After purchasing, I received an email and it had my old address on it. I emailed explaining if they can simply change the address, but to no avail, they reccomended cancelling the order and re order again. Now I'm currently waiting here like a sitting duck for them to re list the specific phone I was gonna buy. I don't know there should be a better system in regards to confirming and clarifying the address or an easier way to change your address after you've paid. Clearly I'm not a scammer trying to change the address because sending an email to customer service using my email address that I ordered with. Extremely frustrating. It's made me reluctant and turned me off from ever buying from reebelo again. Date of experience: January 04, 2025",1,Electronics

You said it was to late the vendor as sent it back. You sent it back and wow yep I was right it still wasn't fixed. I'm still wanting for a explanation as to why you sent a phone back that still wasn't working properly and you never answer the question.You service is appalling.I would like to state if you had fixed the phone the first time like you said you did I wouldn't have had to send it back again.

Within a week of owning the phone, I noticed the back screen was cracked and I had not dropped the phone at all. I was only just able to take it to the Apple Store to get it repaired and I was told it was an US model which changed the type of repair. It would cost $570 to repair the phone, instead of $150.

Chris,NZ,"Updated Jan 6, 2025","MisleadingThey shipped me the wrong phone, when I nlet them know, they were hard to get an answer from, and in the end said I could keep it, and said nothing about anything to pay. A month later, when I was committed to the new phone (having set it up, bought a cover, etc), they informed me I could either pay more than $400 extra or return the phone for replacement with the one I originally ordeed. When I sought to negotiate (as this is totally unaccpetable for a vendor) they were polite, but completely refused to take any real responsblity for not communictaing properly, and would not negotiate at all about amounts to pay.

Psy.D,US,A day ago,"Swappa Staff/Management Lacks Integrity, Is Not Objective, Has Doubled Standards, and Poor Business Practices – DO NOT USE!Ugh! I really have no respect for cowards. That energy is so off-putting. I loathe people who behave like that, cower behind anonymity and delusions of grandeur, and empty titles. This is exacerbated when it is done by a place of business…Swappa back in the day used to be AWESOME. I had my account for OVER 10 years(~36 sold items, ~18 buys, 5-star rating on ALL sales), with ZERO issues. That is until recently…The short:I bought an item from an “enterprise” seller. According to Swappa’s own terms, certain data should be available immediately after you remit payment. There is evident contradiction, ambiguity, miscommunication, and hypocrisy in the treatment of laymen sellers and “enterprise” sellers and their FAQ section. Remember, I have plenty of experience with buying, selling, refund, PayPal, returns, fees, etcetera. *The “enterprise” seller was unable to provide information that should have been made available and/or readily accessible once payment was tendered, according to their own policies, both parties were in violation of this. As a result I opted to decline moving forward with the transaction and asked the “enterprise” seller to just cancel the order, minutes after they said they did not have the specific device information. Weird. They ultimately wanted to assess me a 10% return/restock fee for a device they never shipped out or could even provide me the requested information on and took me through an unnecessary claim with PayPal for almost a week. I reiterate this was dumb and to simply cancel the order/not accept the funds/ or I would be forced to involve PayPal. I waited exactly 24 hours and got nothing. I escalated to PayPal, Swappa deletes my account, I win my PayPal claim, I contact Swappa, no response. TrashDate of experience: November 11, 2024",1,Electronics

I did all the leg work for this seller and the swappa ""support team"" as I called numerous times to USPS to find and figure out where this package was? The ""support team"" did nothing only to say allow 24 hours? Thanks team for the help..  I guess they didn't research anything as the 24 hours would have fallen past the 2 days the seller is suppose to ship.This place didn't help me with anything,.

AN,US,"Updated Jan 6, 2025","Avoid Swappa - Zero buyer protectionsAvoid Swappa. There are zero buyer protections from scam sellers if anything goes wrong. You are on your own in getting a refund by filing a dispute with Paypal since Swappa does not handle the payments. Also, Swappa has no way to make the Seller pay for the return shipping of the defective item. Swappa's vetting of listings is limited to an automated check of IMEI (for phones) and staff looking at the pictures, so anyone can post a perfect picture and sell a defective product. In summary, it is just a glorified Craigslist and you have to blindly trust the seller. Be prepared for the hassle of a Paypal dispute for any defective item refunds, even though you pay a 3% buyers fee to Swappa.Date of experience: November 27, 2024",1,Electronics

PTC STX,US,"Dec 28, 2024Verified","I have used Swappa for over 5 years now…I have used Swappa for over 5 years now and sold over 500 phones. Now I use it to buy occasionally. I have only had one bad experience. That was a time consuming refund, but eventually I got the money returned (due to a camera scammer who never sent the camera.) I will say that, for me-a small business seller—the rules were more strict in selling than some of the larger stores now. I’m seeing dirty items and an increase in general sloppiness/laziness of sellers in providing their best effort. However, that is not entirely Swappa’s fault, as I am seeing that in American society, as well. Date of experience: December 20, 2024",4,Electronics

Swappa was recommended to me by a friend.  “I could find a great deal on phones there.” What I got was $246.14 worth of grief and loss.  I bought a phone as a Christmas gift.  The price was right and the seller indicated it was in great shape (true) and unlocked ready for T-Mobile usage (not true).  Day after Christmas we took the phone to T-Mobile to activate.  We were told that the phone was security locked and could not be unlocked.  We then went to Best Buy for a second opinion.  The tech confirmed that the phone was locked and probably stolen.  He said they see a few of these cases from time to time.  He suggested to contact the seller for help.  This is when the grief started.  When I went back to SWAPPA, they put me in contact with the seller, who is no longer an active seller. The seller swore it was a personal phone and was unlocked prior to shipping, but could not provide a security code to unlock.  Date of experience: November 10, 2024",1,Electronics

I had an iPhone 14 Pro in great condition, but only 80% of the battery remaining. Their suggested price was $550. This is crazy high; most resellers don’t even want the phone unless it’s 85%. - I eventually reduced the price to $440 and one person showed interest. - after paying for shipping and fees, my take was down to ~ $400 and I had to shlep it to pack it and schlep it to UPS- I should have just traded it into apple for $375 - faster, much easier, no dramaDate of experience: December 24, 2024",3,Electronics

So far the product has stood up to the promises made it just would have been beneficial to know it wasn’t going to come with a charger. Additionally there was another post for another item I was looking at that said the item was one thing but when you looked at the description it was another. Not sure if this is common or a one off.

Louis,US,"Dec 22, 2024","As a seller, don't expect Swappa to provide you any goodwillThis is a review from a seller's perspective. This is a lengthy review but I take this seriously. In spite of my rating, I believe in the potential of Swappa as an equal opportunity marketplace for buyers and sellers, and am sharing personal details in hopes that this provides insightful feedback.SUMMARYIf you dispute a buyer, Swappa will absolutely disregard you and leave you to your own devices without goodwill for you as a seller. To be honest and fair to Swappa, a majority of sales were positive. However, one bad sale made me completely lose trust in this marketplace to provide the bare minimum amount of seller protection.MY POSITIVE EXPERIENCES WITH SWAPPAUnfortunately, due to the character limit, I need to keep this brief. I really admire Swappa's commitment to upholding standards for sellers in regards to legitimacy and accuracy of goods. This gives me confidence as a seller that the buyer understands exactly what they are purchasing. The forum/board commenting system is great and I really like being in direct line of communication with each potential buyer to keep everyone honest. I can also praise the payment system and PayPal integration, the website interface and user-friendliness, and high userbase that promotes sales. MY NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE WITH SWAPPAHere, I will recount the full details from my perspective as best I can with the limitation. I sold a used mint condition phone. It was by all accounts, as reviewed and approved by the Swappa staff, a mint condition phone, with multiple detailed and multi-angle photos and video. Following sale of the item, I took a video of me placing said phone into the shipping labeled package as a safe measure. The buyer then opens a case against me stating that there were scratches on the phone with photos, none of which were previously present. There were many back and forths, but to summarize, I was firm in that the buyer was not being honest. I will admit that Swappa staff was very quick in responding to us, and that due to the several reasons, this case seemed fishy to me and I probed with some assumptions. Ultimately, I complied with the buyer with respect to benefit of doubt and in support of Swappa staff who asked of me to resolve this. The buyer proceeded to leave a negative review, which I felt was unjust so I reached out to Swappa for support but was rebuffed.I can accept the monetary loss. However, what I couldn't accept was the response and lack of goodwill from the Swappa team. Hopefully these emails with Swappa help to explain the situation, as well as how it was handled. EMAIL 1 FROM ME""Hi. I would like to request a removal of customer feedback for ---.The buyer complained about the condition of the item not matching my description of it, even though I provided numerous images and a video that clearly show otherwise. I am still highly doubtful it is my fault due to several reasons which I won't belabor here, but I complied with the buyer's demand for a partial refund as not to further escalate the issue and inconvenience the Swappa team. I had no motive or reason to deceive the buyer as I understand ultimately there is no real way to prove foul play on their part once the item is in their hand. And I was willing to accept that risk.I won't raise any more issue beyond this message but my only request is to please remove the feedback. I will take the loss with the partial refund but the feedback from the buyer on top of that stings more.""RESPONSE FROM SWAPPA""I'm afraid we're unable to hide the feedback for this sale since it seems to meet our guidelines: [Link to guidelines]Feel free to work directly with the buyer to see if they're willing to adjust this on their end. Thank you.""EMAIL 2 FROM ME""Thank you but I have to disagree per the guidelines (false summary of the sale) as the feedback stated ""Seller listed phone in mint condition but I received phone in fair condition."" I am adamant that what I sent them is as I listed. I have further proof (a video of me packaging the phone). I forewent showing to nip this in the bud but it was not an admission of fault. I've already worked with the buyer for a solution that satisfies them and don't wish to further engage them. I apologize for pushing back but I feel very seriously about this. I completely understand buyer protection and giving them the benefit of doubt but that should at least, even a little bit, go towards the seller as well. So I am appealing to you, seeing as the buyer is now satisfied whether they are in the right or wrong, to give me as the seller the benefit of doubt and satisfy both parties. There is little downside for Swappa to remove the feedback.""After this, I was rebuffed again similarly and this was left unresolved for me. All in all, I understand nothing can be proven but it was hard not to feel betrayed by the complete one-sidedness.Date of experience: December 17, 2024",2,Electronics

Josh Ferris,US,4 days ago," TrappedI've had a horrible experience with RingCentral. When my business was closing I had to cancel my service. After being a customer for 7 years, they forced me to pay for an additional 10 months that I had on my contract. This is a huge expense for a small business. I can't believe that they would take advantage of their customers by hiding the clause in the small print of the contract. As a busy person, I don't read all the small print. If your company has an legal and/or IT department, perhaps this service would make sense for you. However as a small business owner, I fell into the trap they set. This is not a matter of a customer service failure, this is just the result of RingCentral executing their business plan. I have been trying to close my account, which I was told on two separate occasions would be processed within 24-72 hours. It has now be much longer and I will need to contact them or the BBB to resolve this. RingCentral has had ample opportunity to resolve this.

customer,US,"Nov 29, 2024Verified","RingCentral only has one good feature. The only reason we use RingCentral is for its one-click call recording feature. Beyond that, the service falls short in numerous ways—too many to list— but just a few quick ones: Customer service is a ZERO.  RingCentral is expensive. Very difficult to get them to set up text ability for your company. You cannot choose to block all international calls and you are charged for them when a spammer calls your toll-free number.

The setup was complicated but manageable. However, integration with HubSpot has been a constant headache, and the technical support is generic and unhelpful.One major issue is that adding a new line resets your contract, with no flexibility. If you run a small business and need to adjust the number of users, you could end up stuck paying for extra users until the end of your contract.Also, be aware that the SMS TRC registration process can be a huge pain if you don’t have a website and everything set up perfectly. Even with a website, the registration is unnecessarily difficult.We won't be renewing with RingCentral. They’re quick to take your money but slow to resolve billing issues.

From hidden fees to poor customer service, this company has demonstrated a complete lack of integrity and professionalism. Here’s a breakdown of the key issues we faced:	1.	Hidden Fees and Abusive ChargesWhat began as a $700/month agreement quickly spiraled out of control. Without any authorization or explanation, our bill increased by 300%. Attempts to get clarity were met with vague responses and no accountability.	2.	Forced Auto-RenewalRingCentral employs a predatory practice of forcing auto-renewals. When we decided not to continue our business with them, we were slapped with an outrageous $9,000 fee. This is not only unethical but feels like extortion.	3.	Poor Customer ServiceTheir customer service is one of the worst we’ve encountered. Every issue we raised was either ignored or met with excuses. Not once did they provide a satisfactory resolution to our concerns.	4.	No Resolution to Billing IssuesWe were left with no choice but to change our credit card information to stop them from making unauthorized charges. Even this drastic measure was necessitated by their inability or unwillingness to address the situation.Conclusion:We cannot recommend RingCentral to anyone. Their hidden fees, abusive billing practices, and unresponsive customer service make them a company to avoid at all costs. For a service that started at $700/month to escalate into a $9,000 fee for leaving—this is not how reputable businesses operate.

Lisa Anderson,AU,"Oct 23, 2024","Flawless Experience! We’ve had the same phone system for the past 5 years and decided it was time for an upgrade. After compiling 5 different proposals, it was clear that Sanjay from Ring Central not only offered the best pricing but also provided an outstanding phone system that has exceeded our expectations.Sanjay handled everything from organizing all of our headsets to delivering the most incredible service we have ever received. Not only did he flawlessly complete the phone system conversion, but he went above and beyond by fixing our internet, which had been problematic for years—something our previous IT company couldn’t resolve. On top of that, he secured us a faster internet service that’s 4 times faster than our previous one, and at a better price!Sanjay’s & Thomas dedication, expertise, and commitment on installation day to ensure everything ran smoothly was exceptional. We are beyond grateful for their support and highly recommend Sanjay, Thomas and Ring Central to anyone looking for top-tier service and solutions.Date of experience: October 23, 2024",5,Electronics

Josh Ferris,US,"Updated Oct 30, 2024","Horrid I've had a horrible experience with RingCentral. When my business was closing I had to cancel my service. After being a customer for 7 years, they forced me to pay for an additional 10 months that I had on my contract. This is a huge expense for a small business. I can't believe that they would take advantage of their customers by hiding the clause in the small print of the contract. As a busy person, I don't read all the small print. If your company has an legal and/or IT department, perhaps this service would make sense for you. However as a small business owner, I fell into the trap they set. This is not a matter of a customer service failure, this is just the result of RingCentral executing their business plan. I have been trying to close my account, which I was told on two separate occasions would be processed within 24-72 hours. It has now be much longer and I will need to contact them or the BBB to resolve this. RingCentral has had ample opportunity to resolve this. I have agreed to pay out the contract, but still they have not processed it. I will never use RingCentral again. Date of experience: October 23, 2024",1,Electronics

It was by far the WORST experience I have ever had with any service provider. Not only did they fail to help me in any meaningful way, but they also had the audacity to try and squeeze more money out of me when I needed their understanding and support the most.Firstly, I called their customer service to inform them of my situation and inquire about terminating my account. They acknowledged that I was under contract and, instead of providing me with any reasonable solutions, offered an absurd flat rate to close my account. It felt like they were taking advantage of my circumstances and trying to profit off my misfortune.To make matters worse, I decided to call back today to see if any progress had been made or if any notes had been left on my account. Unsurprisingly, there were NO NOTES documenting our previous conversation, leaving me right back where I started.As a result, I am now stuck continuing to pay for a service I no longer need for my closed business. Their complete lack of empathy, terrible communication, and inflexible policies have left me feeling helpless and frustrated. I strongly advise anyone considering RingCentral to steer clear and look for an alternative provider that genuinely cares about their customers and their needs.Date of experience: November 20, 2024",1,Electronics

Just this morning, they change my assigned phone number to a different number without any notification. Feel very disrespectful as being a loyal customer to this company. When I called them to find out what the situation was, they told me they can not find anything that relates to the previous assigned number... I think it is time to replace this company with a better one. They charge extra fee for messages and calls and all other features. Their work review process is very very slow and possibly need the help of efficiency department from the new government. Update: After spent hours in the afternoon looking for the assigned account manager, I was able to get a hold of the account manager and he was able to expedite this situation and restore one of the phone number that was originally assigned to me. However, there is another phone number that they did not restore yet and hopefully they can restore within the next 24 hours. Also, I am still waiting on TCR registration review, which I personally think it takes too long to process and they shut off the outbound message function. With that being said, it creates inconvenience to  business operation and customers. Hopefully, they can speed up the review process. Update:Ring Central creates complexity to TCR brand and TCR registration. A simple registration takes weeks and weeks to review and after correction another weeks and weeks of my time. Step 1 is TCR brand, step 2 is TCR registration and it does not allow me to complete step 2 if step 1 is still in reviewing process which I understood. Here is the worst part. Initially, Ring Central asked me to add a website on TCR brand and I did and they took forever to review and later I found out they took off the information that was already on there and they did not help me add the website that I asked for. I feel like I will never get this TCR registration completed. This company definitely needs some help with efficiency on solving issues. Date of experience: November 23, 2024",1,Electronics

After 3 levels of approval and lots of back-and-forth, RingCentral did the right thing and allowed us to downgrade our contract without early termination fee.  Worth mentioning is that RingCentral's software does work well, our reason for switching to another provider was technical and not due to RingCentral's product being unsatisfactory. BEWARE THE ANNUAL CONTRACTSJust make sure that if you purchase/take over an existing business that has contracts in place with providers such as RingCentral, that you obtain copies of ALL CONTRACTS and have the previous owner fill you in on ALL DETAILS.We recently ported most of our numbers to another carrier and requested to cancel our unused licenses with RingCentral. The billing support team is utterly inflexible and unwilling to work with us, claiming we are locked into a contract that we NEVER signed; and with an absurd cancellation fee built in. This blindsided us and they did not care. They should allow the USER to remove licenses at their own discretion, but it's designed in such a way that users can ONLY add licenses and can NOT remove them, and although it says ""contact support to remove licenses"" but when you DO contact support, they refuse to remove the licenses until the following year (in our case, March 2025). They did help us eventually, once we were able to prove we genuinely were unaware of the annual contract with the previous owner 10 years ago, and we had never signed and thought the service was month-to-month.Date of experience: November 02, 2024",4,Electronics

Amber,US,"Nov 5, 2024","Bad Business Practices for Automatic Contract RenewalsOur Company signed on with services from RingCentral with high hopes for our phone system as we get a great deal of phone calls during our busy season. The website is unreliable and up until the last few months, when adding a line, there was no option to use existing licenses. The site would push you through the options and you would then be locked into an additional license that would automatically renew. Over the last month, I have reached out to RingCentral multiple times. Each time requesting to speak with a manager, and each time I was met with resistance. In fact, I never actually spoke to a supervisor once. Information was exchanged through a customer service rep that would then submit my concerns via chat to their supervisor and I would have to wait for a response. Despite informing them of their contractual obligations and the legal requirements in both California and Virginia to handle automatically renewing contracts, I was told that to make any changes, we would be responsible for paying the remaining balance of the lines we wished to remove through the end of our contract.Per California state law, businesses providing a service or product subject to automatic renewal, are required to send a notice to the consumer prior to the date of the current contracts end to provide them with the option to terminate the contract. This was never done and when brought up to RingCentral, I was told that they do not send these notices and again I was told to reference the contract. I recommend any individual or company that utilized this company for VoIP services, review the terms of their contract and how the automatic renewal is displayed, to determine if they have the same issues. We will be reaching out to see our options with legal representation and requesting a review for class action options.Date of experience: November 04, 2024",1,Electronics

I have been having a heck of a time getting any resolutions, or even any replies in many cases, and oftentimes, the replies feel canned like they are just going through a script and not truly looking at the circumstances of my problems. Even if their support was adequate, the product is missing several basic features, such as presence sync between their EX and CX products. Every other contact center solution I have worked with lets other internal employees know when someone in the contact center is on the phone, but not this one! Of course this was not disclosed to me prior to implementation, and I did not think to ask because it feels to me like asking if a car comes with tires.

Most of the challenges related to technical support for the Nice product. Although our support team has a great handle on RC, Their Nice product knowledge is lacking. To make things more challenging the support documentation is vague and really does not dive deep. We wanted to allow our users to see Agent lists on shared dashboards. We followed the instructions help article, but it did not work. After 2 days of troubleshooting and going to tier 3 support, we found out the issue was very simple. Agent list is an ACD widget. It can be turned on under ACD access in the admin console. As this is just a feature of the product and it was not broken both the Agents, and the support documentation failed us.

The Bridge Clinic,NZ,"Sep 25, 2024","A copy of my BB complaint; unable to cancel serviceA copy of my BB complaint;I am writing to formally file a complaint against RingCentral, Inc. regarding their business practices related to the cancellation of services. My experience, which I believe is shared by many others, raises significant concerns about the ethics and transparency of your operations.I operate a free medical clinic for uninsured patients in our community, relying entirely on volunteers and donations from local medical systems. Our clinic, which serves a vital role in our area, has been a longtime customer of RingCentral for many years. During this time, I have been willing to tolerate increasing fees — from $155 a year to $320 for fax service alone — due to what I believed to be quality service and support.Unfortunately, our experience with RingCentral over the past year has been disheartening. We encountered numerous problems while attempting to add a simple soft phone for a volunteer, which culminated in extensive interactions with your customer service team. I found their communication to be laden with technical jargon that seemed designed to confuse rather than clarify. After receiving inconsistent information regarding the soft phone, we resolved to switch to a different service provider that offers the same fax capabilities at nearly a third of the cost—$128 annually.Now that we have successfully ported our number to the new company, I have been trying for days to cancel our RingCentral account and obtain a refund for the remaining six months of service. My attempts to cancel online were unsuccessful, as the option to do so simply does not exist, despite what is shown on the web site. I also attempted to cancel via chat and through various customer service numbers, only to be repeatedly disconnected and directed back to your website. I spent over 2 hours on ‘hold’ with the chatbot waiting for a representative and over 90 min on hold on the phone.When I finally managed to speak with a customer service representative, my experience was far from satisfactory. After waiting over an hour and being placed on hold again, I was met with a rude operator who misattributed call drops to my actions. This left me feeling frustrated and disheartened, at which time I sadly lost my temper (for which I apologize) especially when my subsequent attempts to reach out for support through chat, Facebook, and ticket submissions yielded no satisfactory results.  I did, however finally receive a response via the chat service, after 15 hours, at which time I was sound asleep!  So, they disconnected since I didn't answer...This morning, I received yet another call from your customer service. After a convoluted discussion filled with vague terms and technical language, I directly inquired about the status of our $160 refund. It was distressing to hear a firm ""no"" in response. This amount represents nearly two months of our operating budget, further exacerbating my disappointment in RingCentral's current ethical standards.Many others appear to share my sentiment, as indicated by the numerous complaints lodged against RingCentral on the Better Business Bureau website. It seems that your company is systematically barring customers from cancelling their accounts and employing deceptive practices to retain funds, even in cases where accounts have been closed.It is disheartening to witness what seems to be a shift from RingCentral's formerly reputable service to practices that could be deemed unethical. I sincerely hope that you will address these issues, not only for the benefit of my clinic but for all your customers who are facing similar challenges.Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.Date of experience: September 24, 2024",1,Electronics

Vanessa,AU,"Sep 23, 2024","Poor Service. Dodgy contract. Read the fine print, review your contract at least 3 months prior to expiry date or you'll be locked in for an eternity. Our IT company introduced us to RingCentral after we needed to move from a landline phone system to VOIP. With their assistance, it was easy enough to set up, and the YeahLink phones we purchased at the same time, are still operational 5 years later. However the service is extremely lacking, especially if you're outside of your initial 24 month contract, so when we  contacted RingCentral assistance from RingCentral to correct issues caused by an unplanned, unreported update, we were left fixing the issue in all our user profiles and YeahLink hardware ourselves. It was time consuming and infuriating. If we were a much bigger company it would have been a mammoth job. The lack of service lead us to start the process of parting ways with RingCentral and find a new Voip provider, however RingCentral wouldn't respond to our notification that we were parting ways or provide information to facilitate the move, and eventually after multiple calls or emails, they responded advising that we were still in contract for another 12 months, because their contracts renew automatically for 24 months after the expiry date. Now we're stuck in a battle, trying to get out of the contract that shouldn't be legally binding in Australian consumer law, but can't get anyone at RingCentral to respond to us. Do NOT sign with RingCentral or any telco who has a contracted period, and if you do, mark it in your email calendar to review 3 months prior to the expiry date so you can cancel the service in writing 30 days (I'd give 90 days if you can, and then keep contacting them to confirm, because they won't respond).

After researching my options I ported my virtual number to MS Teams, saving $550 per year. Ring Central does not enable you to cancel their services without speaking to an agent. I spent nearly three hours on hold trying to reach an agent, only for the agent to try to sell me on four plans and then to inform me that they require a 30 notice to cancel the plan. To be clear, I signed my agreement seven years ago and did not remember this in the fine print - but find it extremely shady that nothing in the admin portal outlining how to cancel an account reminds users that they must notify Ring Central 30 days in advance. It's also interesting that I was able to reach a sales agent in less than 5 minutes, but reaching an agent to cancel took 3 hours of hold time on the phone.

Told them I was giving up and going to use another calibration, SpyderXPro. Amazingly they came back and said they were pleased Palette Master was now working and never replied when I pointed out no it wasn’t.

Also, how rude they where along with their lack of willingness to just solve our issue/ issues instead of passing the issue or issues to the next guy is a problem... it's clear they don't have an interest in working with small businesses.

It was beyond the 6 mo. warranty period so I just dealt with it until it came up with a message that it was time to replace the lamp because it had over 7500 hours on it! New lamp they said? I could have left it on 24/7 and it wouldn't have clocked those hours! Not to mention, how much had this thing been used before I purchased it. ""Refurbished"" takes on a whole new meaning.

The last one, the ht3050 has lasted (the others only 6 months or less) 3 plus years. But unlike most projectors the bulb never goes dim and poor picture.  Nope. It blows up.  Every.  Single. Time.  Then when you try to get a hold of BenQ support they don't answer.  I've sent 3 emails and have been on hold for over an hour and 20 minutes. No answers and their answering service hangs up on you.    Again I love the products when they work and actually want to try their ht3550 (it had a different bulb and looks awesome) but I can't even get their sales people to answer the dang phone.

I got the BenQ XL2411 model and I absolutely love it. The ease of customization of making sure the picture colors and quality are exactly to my preference was an exciting experience because using other monitors it's just ""standard/movie/etc"" but with this monitor it has ""FPS1/FPS2/GAMER1/etc"" and if the prebuilt settings aren't to your liking, you can tweak them and save them as your own personalized setting. All of these features, the ease of accessing the features, and the overall quality of the monitor blew me away. I highly recommend this screen to anyone debating on what screen to buy; if you can afford it. But honestly your monitor is what you will be staring at the entire time while using your pc, might as well make it an experience worth looking at!

Subhankar Barai,US,"Updated Aug 20, 2018Verified","Not so great RMA process and quality controlI received the first monitor as a broken one. It was surprising for me specially because it looked like the break was not from the shipment handling as the box and the package looked okay. The monitor frame had a dent OUTWARD as if someone had inserted a screw driver on one side and bent the frame outward. A hit on the box from outside cannot do such a bend on the monitor frame.  The monitor glass could not be understood as broken, until I powered it on.I called helpdesk and an RMA email was sent to me after 4 days of calling. This was a delay I did not like and was almost going to call again when I saw the RMA email come in. THE RMA process is also not as streamlined as others as you have to provide serial number, product number and other info and send a filled up form before you can get an RMA number or a shipping label. My experience with others have been to call and provide just the order number. So it is a two step process and took a solid 4-5 days before I could get a shipping label. My deduction of two star is because of the above mentioned facts.However, once I sent back the monitor, a second shipment was sent on the same day they received the monitor back. The customer service person was cooperative/polite in the discussions.So the 3 stars.Hopefully this feedback is taken in a constructive manner to improve the process.Did I mention that the second monitor is as good as new?

I called in on 12/27 to cancel, was told I would get a refund in a week.  A week passes, I get an email that the monitor shipped.  I called and asked what was going on.  I got another well it shipped and there is nothing we can do about it so you will just have to send it back when it arrives.  So monitor comes, I ship it back, expecting a refund to come.  Nope, still sitting here today 1/24 with no refund.  I have called to ask what is going on and been hung up on, yelled at, talked over, and no answer to when I am going to get my refund.  This company is a fraud and has the WORST customer service I have seen.  Do you business somewhere else.Date of experience: January 24, 2019",1,Electronics

Miss PW,GB,"Feb 16, 2021","Awful! Still awaiting my refund on a faulty monitor!ZERO STARS! I ordered a PD2700U monitor (costing over £400) directly from the BenQ website on the 8th Jan, it arrived swiftly on the 13th January. The moment I opened it, noticed it was faulty and immediately contacted BenQ customer service to report this, with photos and videos. BenQ customer service said to send further images of it switched on, I really didn't want to get it out of all of its packaging if I needed to return it but followed their advise. They advised they would organise for an exchange at my door and someone would contact me between 2 to 5 working days. I heard nothing. Contacted BenQ about their silence, they blamed Brexit for the delay yet they were able to send me a monitor from the Netherlands by the 13th January (within a week after I ordered it). Gave them a chance and waited a further week for the exchange. Radio silence yet again. This time requested a refund as I am losing business and valuable time on projects without a monitor. They apologised for the delay and suggested I request the refund from their website under my order details. I did this and UPS picked up my monitor. My monitor didn't move from Tamworth UPS centre for over a week so I contacted them. They advised my monitor had been deemed lost so I needed to raise a claim to investigate. Their claims form on the website wouldn't accept my details. rang UPS back, they said I can't raise the claim due to BenQ being the contracting company so they have to do it. I contacted BenQ and told them the info UPS had given me and that I wanted my refund asap! BenQ then said to leave it with them they would deal with it and process my refund immediately. That was 2 weeks ago now! Last week on Monday my original monitor was delivered back to me by UPS stating that due to Brexit, European boarders will not accept the return back into the country without an ""internal invoice"". I contacted BenQ straight away to inform them, They organised an RMA to a UK partner company to accept the return on their behalf, I was still meant to have received my refund by now, still nothing. The partner company Equinox arranged a very quick pickup of my monitor via DHL, it was picked up 2 days after it arrived back to my property. Chased my refund 6 days ago. BenQ's customer care said unable to process refund as they need an IBAN and Swift details. Contacted my bank to get these from them (but this wasn't originally needed in order to buy the damn thing in the first place). Sent them over the same day... no update on my refund at all. There doesn't seem to be a complaints department or senior management to deal directly with. The stress this has caused me is unreal. I am still awaiting my refund of over £400 with BenQ unable to advise me on what the hold up is! RIDICULOUS!Date of experience: February 16, 2021",1,Electronics

I thought great thank you I was so excited as I'm semidisabled with mental health problems and dealing this sort of thing can be a real struggle for me..The exchange arrived in a tiny box it had been completely taken apart, it had no bolts, not covers to hide bolts, no PSU, it was really dirty like muddy dirty and the screen was smashed so bad it could never have happened on one delivery.. Even the DHL diver was shocked he told me to refuse the delivery on the grounds it's not been boxed right and was clearly E WASTE and not a referbishesd monitor I was promised by benQ!! I'm left shaking because it was a one off warranty so they can just say we tried sorry but I can't afford to spend £700 on a monitor that breaks down twice in under 2years, I wish you upload pictures because this monitor was out of a top for sure and there's is no hiding that fact.. I informed benQ of my disabilities and they where really understanding and my monitor has just sat on my desk it's in immaculate condition Vs this dogs dinner they tried to exchange it for really really disappointed, the delivery driver was really really nice though and broke DHL rules to let me open the box because he could tell something was badly wrong and that I needed help.. What was really annoying was benQ insisted I found an appropriate box to the point I had to spend £30 buying a huge box + packing for a monitor this size and then they send out this broken junk in a box 10x to small with no packing it's really really shocking still can't get over it left me shaken..Date of experience: September 27, 2022",1,Electronics

Dennis,US,"Jun 7, 2018Verified","I purchased a refurbished PD2710QCI purchased a refurbished PD2710QC. When it arrived, the right corner of the display was cracked, I hoped that it was just a one-time shipping issue. BenQ quickly processed a replacement. However, the 2nd time around a left corner of the display was cracked. This time I wasn't sure what to think, but I e-mailed to let BenQ know. Sean from BenQ gave me a call and explained this has happened in the past, and it seems that both display cracks could have been caused while shipping via Fedex. He helped me process an advanced replacement and finally I have a non-cracked display to use! I am happy with the service although it took quite some time to process. My recommendation is to wrap refurb models more securely, especially monitor corners. Another option is to mark item as fragile while shipping.Date of experience: June 07, 2018",4,Electronics

Anthony Ward,US,"Jun 5, 2018Verified","Worst buying experience of my lifeI am 69 years old, and this was by far the worst buying experience in my life !On May 11, I ordered a refurb HT2050 projector. The return verification Email said that the projector would ship in approximately 2 days. By May 17, I had not received any correspondence from BenQ, so I called and spoke to Tim. Tim told me that the order was on some sort of fraud hold, but could not give me any specific details, but would find out and let me know. He also told me that my credit card had not been charged, as they do not charge your account until the order is shipped.On May 18, I had not heard anything back, and called again. Tim became quite aggravated with me and told me again that my account had not been charged and I could just cancel the order. I told him I did not want to cancel, I just wanted them to ship the projector. Tim then hung up on me. I then contacted my credit card company, and was told the yes, BenQ had charged my account the same day the original order had been placed.I called back and spoke to Tim again, told him that contrary to what he had told me, my account had been charged my account had been charged. He then asked me why don't I just buy it somewhere else and proceeded to hang up on me again.I then called back and spoke to Andy, who was quite courteous. He explained that the shipping address was erroneous , and that was why the order was not shipped. It turned out that the zip code had two numbers transposed. By this time I was wondering if BenQ was just going to keep my money, never ship, and never contact me. Andy then cancelled my first order, and I ordered again, this time with the correct address. The projector arrived about three days later.It is now June 5, and my credit card has still not been credited for the first order. I called BenQ, spent over an hour on hold, and was not able to speak to anyone. I guess that I will have to protest the charges with Visa since BenQ seems to have no respect for their customers.Date of experience: June 05, 2018",1,Electronics

I saw the review for this unit on Secrets of Home Theater, and decided to make the plunge.  For less than a new TV, I'm getting a 100"" screen and a fabulous movie theater like experience.  I'm not sure how much better it would be if I had gotten a 4k or 4k pixel shifted unit with hdr, but I know I would have spent much more.  My only regret is that i didn't do this sooner.  I think I ended up being more worried about my screen choice than the choice for this projector.

He told me what he recommended so I checked it out, immediately went to the website because I'd found what I'd been looking for on Amazon. Found it to be a few $$$ less and thought okay, its cheaper here. But I also noticed that there was a coupon to save 25% on refurbished products and thought I'd check to see if the same monitor was on here refurbished and to my luck it was. So I got the same monitor that was $250 on Amazon brand new, refurbished for $170. I got the BenQ ZOWIE 24"" XL2411 PC eSports Gaming Monitor, and I've been using it for over a month now and I'm super happy with my purchase, so yea I'd recommend BenQ, also I was able to pay with my Amazon Account which was pretty cool so it just made it easier.Date of experience: May 21, 2018",5,Electronics

I called wanting to re-credit my mother-in-laws account. I was on my lunch break, so I had limited time. After several minutes of questions about myself and being asked for everything but a DNA sample. Again, this re-credit was not for my account, and I had her phone number, name, etc. All I wanted to do was give them money, but apparently they didn't want it. The last straw was when he asked for the name of her phone provider. What DIFFERENCE does this make!!! By this time I was irritated and asked why he needed to know. At which time he hung up. I didn’t bother to call back. I deleted my account and will recommend that all my family and friends do the same.

Perfect for uninstalling MS Edge browser which starts in the background (as can be seen in the task manager) and doesnt allow you to uninstall it by default. It even goes digging into the registry and straight up moIests the program you were uninstalling by removing all traces of it. I just love that part. The only reason I'm dropping a star is the annoying as fk popups, and the dodgy installation process where they set the ""cancel"" button to continue instead of cancel. Essentially trying to trip you up if you dont want to install other programs like their VPN during installation, or if you're trying to uninstall one of the programs.

Ironically, Microsoft hadn't properly managed or updated these drivers.

If that is happening, that should tell you something.Advanced System Care started out as pretty nice software package.  They have slowly divided the individual software programs into separate packages so you now have to buy 4-5 different bundles.  So costs have gone way up over the years.  However, it RELENTLESSLY, has pop-ups come up on your screen trying to get you to buy more of their products.  I am talking about multiple times a day.  And there is no way to turn it off except to completely uninstall this software.  I sent multiple messages to IObit which they just ignore.  This last part is pure speculation on my part.  The underlining feeling for the company I have is that they are kinda slimy.  I could never get in contact with anyone.  And just everything I read from other posts.

I have asked them a few times why the money was taken out in the first place, but I never get an answer. I would say to anyone dealing with this company, you are taking a big chance giving them your bank details. As a pensioner I can't afford some large company dipping into my bank account to take what they want. I also asked them to remove my bank details from their records, but never received a reply to this.Their software is all fancy bells and bangles on screen making you think the software is doing something, but it is actually leaving coding behind deep within your system.

These apps keep my system running at top performance at all times.  The programs are super light weight... they actually improve performance rather than drag it down like so many others.  These products help your pc to consistently run better than it does day one out of the box... and this really says something considering the nature of windows.  Im an avid gamer and my system can run titles beyond the spec of my pc fluently... much better than more powerful systems that have not been optimised.

Only to find out that it was not expired or near expired. When used their support link to contact them, I was ""assisted"" by the most obnoxious person I have ever encountered in customer service. I was asking for the expiration date of my software to be extended since I had what amounted to double coverage for that particular program. It took a month for me to get that straightened out. Since then, my laptop took a crap and I am using an older one that already had IOBit programs installed but they were out of date. Since it was late at night and I needed the program right then, I renewed them through a package deal where I got their Driver Booster, Disk Defrag, Advanced Care System and Software Updater for several PCs at a discounted price. I just installed them all and on every installation there is fine print at the bottom of the permission to install screen asking to install other software, namely itop VPN, itop screen recorder and itop EZ Desktop. Although I opted out of installing these programs, I still ended up with the itop VPN and the itop screen recorder installed on my laptop somehow. I uninstalled them using IOBits own uninstaller and there doesn't seem to be any problems with it but I do not like the fact that they installed other software that not only did I not ask for but that I indicated to their installer that I did not want. They should recognize that its not all about money all the time.

Ron Redner,IL,"Updated Jul 19, 2023","ASC Pro - For Great Overall System Maintenance...I have been using Iobit's Advanced System Care Pro version for several years. Despite some of the negative reviews I have read, this has not been my personal experience with the company. To begin with, ASC Pro performs reliably. I know what to expect and the company has demonstrated throughout the years that they are responsible and are not interested in playing games with me. When I have opened a ticket they went above and beyond what I had expected of them and actually helped me with an issue I don't really think fell under their realm of responsibility. But their training is such that they genuinely wanted to help me. That's a great attitude. It demonstrates that they sincerely have my best interests at heart.Their product - ASC, quiets down the activity of my desktop to a tolerable minimum and I hardly hear my PC making noise after I run a system scan.I don't rely on ASC for Virus Scans, because my experience wasn't that great when it came to virus scans ASC performed. However, that said, as a overall system maintenanceprogram, it is reasonably priced (I think I paid around $13 through a promotional).They also gave me the option up front, to be able to turn off autopay, which I do in fact turn off.I recommend ASC Pro, because I think the value I get out of ASC PRO by far justifies the expense in terms of peace of mind and not having to endlessly babysit my desktop and tinker every few hours. Also, ASC Pro comes with many advanced features that are not included in the free version and if your PC starts having issues and things aren't working right, there is a toolbox that I use that has allowed me to resolve pressing issues which I would not have been able to resolve on my own without a lot of effort and pain.

Gary Laws,GB,"May 14, 2023","Great software, ruined by bullying sales tactics.After a year of using IObit products, I completely understand why they polarise their customers so badly, and have such an odd reputation. I purchased a sale bundle they offered last year, which included their system maintenance, driver management and software uninstaller apps. I later went on to add their screen recording app. The software itself is all great, especially their screen recording app, but even though I subscribed to many of their apps for 12 months, they will still carpet bomb you with various nags for apps you may absolutely not require. For example, my VPN is part of my Norton installation, yet IObit keep trying to push their own VPN, it's infuriating! Based purely on the software performance, I would have no problem either subscribing to the same apps for another year, or buying the lifetime licenses for several of their apps. But I simply don't want to go another 12 months with their frequent popups, sale notifications and nag screens. It is such a shame, because their screen recording software (iTop Screen Recorder) is brilliant. There are a couple of reviewers recently that advised users to simply install better browser AdBlock extensions. I do not believe that these are genuine users, because the popups come from within the background app services running within the operating system. They have nothing! to do with your internet browser. It is also frustrating to see IObit staff replying to Trustpilot reviewers, and yet they do nothing! to address customer issues. The apps themselves are fantastic, all IObit would need do, to enhance their reputation, is stop trying to bully customers into buying more products from their catalogue. All my apps have recently expired, and I would love to purchase another set of licenses. But because of the sales tactics used by IObit, I am instead rather looking forward to removing every atom of software from my laptop, to get rid of all the popup noise that the IObit apps generate.Date of experience: May 14, 2023",3,Electronics
Andy Expert,US,"May 7, 2023","Decent tools, bad company management.I downloaded the Advanced System Care and Driver Booster, free versions on both. ASC works like CCleaner. Cleans junk files, checks the registry, etc. Plus, other features that CCleaner does not have, even in their paid version. Driver Booster won't update all of your drivers for free, but it does show you the ones that require pro, so you can manually update them if needed on your own.Now the bloatware issue. As of 5-7-2023, installing Advance System Care will install 3 pieces of software: ITop VPN, Screen Recorder, and Screenshot tool. I can almost guarantee that the company is going to reply and say that I ""forgot"" to uncheck the boxes. I used Revo to clean uninstall it and redownloaded. Same three bloatwares. They are easy to get rid of, antivirus didn't flag them or anything. Also the VPN program added a desktop UI widget that showed my CPU usage and say that I wasn't secure, even though I was already connected to my paid VPN service, so seems the program has no idea how secure my system actually is and just tells me that I need to turn on its VPN service. It's scummy tactics and bad marketing. And annoying.But hey, its a free program. After reading reviews of people who paid them for the PRO versions I can say I would never pay for any of this. Any company that continues to badger its paying customers to spend more money doesn't care about its customers. Which is a shame because the tools seems to be pretty decent. We should show companies (with our wallets) that they shouldn't be harassing customers with popups to buy more services when they clearly would rather your products just do what they are supposed to do and not interrupt their work. So, until they actually get their marketing issues resolved I would avoid paying for their PRO services.

A friend told me about ASC and I did a comparison against Iolo System Mechanic back then.  ASC came out the clear winner, as far as care taken with registry and cleaning.  The only thing that can be annoying is the constant pushing of the add-on promotional partner software, but I deal with it.  I know how to upgrade and skip past all that.  I use Advanced System Care, Driver Booster, and Uninstaller as my staple utilities, and have recommended them to friends and aquaintances.  The defaults are great, but if you really want to get the most out of these tools, download and read the user manual for each of these software utilities, and you will find you can learn and ""tweak"" them to exactly what you want them to do.Date of experience: May 14, 2022",5,Electronics

HERMAN G. LEWIS,US,"May 7, 2022","Subtle issue with ASC toolbox featureI have been a user of Advanced Systems Care (ASC) ever since it was first released several+ years ago.   I first installed the first free version on my Gateway computer and used this for a few years.  Upon realizing how well it was working for me, I upgraded to the latest PRO version at that time.   It was only about a year and a half ago that this old Windows ""98"", then ""XP"" and then ""7"" based same Gateway computer gave out, that I decided to get me one of the ""newer fast guy"" laptops on the market.   All the time, I was using the Gateway with the various Windows programs and the different versions of ASC, I never, ever had any issues with the ASC and all its ""toolbox"" goodies and along with using the Malware Fighter.   The ASC kept me out of trouble, clean and functioning very well.  After I bought my Lenovo Yoga C740 (15.6"") laptop which had and still has Windows 10, and installed ASC 14 PRO and the Malware Fighter, everything was still good.  It wasn't until I later realized that after I used the ""Driver Booster"", which is in the ASC toolbox package, that strange operational things - like the touchpad not working or the sound shutting down - started to happen.   To make an almost two-year fight story short, the issue turned out to be that the Lenovo laptops have their own unique drivers and when the Driver Booster program was run, the Booster program determined the Lenovo Driver to be out of date and replaced it.   The Lenovo just did not like that exchange.   After almost two years we figured this out and I first would only use only the Lenovo updates to update the Drivers and whatever and second, I just don't use the Driver Booster at all.   When a computer’s resident applications needs it, these computers are smart enough that they will go off and find their own updates on the internet.  So, in conclusion, I can say I am totally pleased with the operation of the ASC 15 PRO and its toolbox of all sorts of goodies and have found no problems with any of the support apps, with the exception of the Booster on the Lenovo laptop.   In comparison, the two Gateways my wife and I had and my wife’s current HP Envy have had no issues with the Driver Booster nor any of the other resident apps in the package.  I bring this event up, in that I recall reading in these reviews that several people were having computer performance issues when the ASC was installed.   These folks may want to look at things like the drivers if they are using  the Driver Booster in the ASC package.   Another app I am also watching is the Software Updater.   At this time I am still experimenting with it as I am not totally comfortable with that one yet.   Hope this info will be useful to someone.Date of experience: May 07, 2022",5,Electronics

Every year when I renew, the new expiration date is always 1 year from the date of purchase, not a full year added to the existing subscription. Every year I have to make a complaint to support, which I'm happy to say they aways fix, no problem. Seems like it would be easy to differentiate a renewal from a new purchase but it happens time. Addition: Good morning,Your reply mentions renewal of an existing code vs. purchasing a new code, and I don't recall ever seeing that option. I do shop around a bit for the best deal as the purchase price varies from site to site. I queried the last purchase over the effective date issue and their reply indicated that I would need to contact IObit. I know at the time of purchase that their advert seemed to indicate that I was purchasing a renewal. Now I don't mind telling you it would be my preference to make purchases directly through IObit, but that option for renewal is always the most expensive. It would seem to me that a long-term customer such as myself would receive a more ""special"" price offer to encourage renewal. In any event, I do wish you to know that I'm pleased with the product you provide and have been since my original purchase some 10+ years ago.

I was happy to find minimal bloatware and that the latest Nvidia driver was pre-installed. The cable management was awesome too which is a plus.

After I was sure the AIO was dead I emailed back a few hours later and in under 24 hours from my very first email I was offered a free replacement with no hassle. My support agent was Adriana and all communication was professional and friendly, I was offered any assistance I needed in getting the return together and had constant status updates on when they could see it in the mail, when they received it, and when the replacement was sent out. On top of that because they didn't make the same model of AIO anymore they upgraded me to the current top of the line AIO to match the tier of what I had purchased 4 years ago even though the current one is slightly more expensive.

I've contacted their support via email and the web site and the only answer I've been given is that they don't know. The one time I was able to speak to a human on the phone, they couldn't provide a reason why the PC is late or even an estimate.Very concerned that NZXT are going to ruin a little boys Christmas.If anyone from NZXT reads this the support ticket number is 2083957.Please do better NZXT, your paying customers deserve more from you.UPDATE 20th December.NZXT closed my support ticket without providing any update but created a new one 2096106 for no reason. This is really shocking, I called them yesterday and they either don't have the ability to track where and what stage the order is at or they just lieUPDATE 23rd DecemberFinally got an update from NZXT two days ago, the PC is built after waiting on a GPU and they also sent a free NZXT keyboard, it's all been delivered today which has delighted my son.

Their defect rate is probably 50%. What doesn't break right after installation breaks right after the warranty period expires. The number of negative reviews on Amazon is simply incredible. How do they still work and produce these low-quality fakes?Date of experience: October 02, 2024",1,Electronics

Aaron Gentry,US,"Dec 9, 2024","Not flexible customer service.Order number: 584827Order date: 2024-12-03 07:32I want to say that a lot of the recent news about NZXT is a bit troubling. I've seen both the complaints and NZXT's response. I am not here to flame NZXT. I am here to give a fair review of my experience.The ordering process was actually fun and a couple of the pre-sale phone reps were very nice and relatable.  I appreciated those phone calls. Picking out parts was also fun and I like the design, layout and functionality of the website. I was a liottle disappointed by the lack of motherboard options supporting the i9 14900.  But not a huge deal.Here is where I was a little disappointed. I made an order for a custom build totaling approximately $3100.  I bought two ssd drives for my custom build and asked that the smaller of the two be used for windows installation. I received a response after the transaction was complete that basically said they cannot complete that request.  He said that they HAVE TO install it on the faster drive, that they have no other choice. That's odd. I'm not certain there's a huge enough difference between Samsung m.2 drives and Western Digital m.2 drives to make a difference. This is really a ""can't do"" attitude driven policy. This also differs from the pre-sale customer service representative who told me we could install it that way - that's the way everyone installs them. And the person who responded just marked the ticket resolved without me having been able to respond back. It felt like ""sorry - thats too much trouble. Goodbye."" I didn't feel like a valued customer. I almost felt like they put all the happy nice people in pre-sales, and then after that they got my money and not much help after that. Some companies do indeed operate this way. I hope it's not the way NZXT does. I hope this was an isolated incident.This was my first experience with NZXT. Not off to a great start and I don't even have the PC yet. I'm disappointed and after hearing some recent unfortunate news about NZXT and in conjunction to what I heard about my request I'm nervous about this purchase. Having some buyers remorse and not feeling a lot of purchasing confidence for the future.But I hope NZXT will see that this review is fair and not just here to flame and review bomb. I hope they will address this kind of silly policy to not install Windows on the drive of my choice.Date of experience: December 02, 2024",3,Electronics

Initial delays to my initial response was very weak and so you don’t feel like a high sense of urgency when it comes to orders. DPD are absolutely abysmal for my area so coupled that with a £35 delivery fee, you’d expect the highest service for the delivery (getting my new car delivered was cheaper?). Paid a premium for a delivery service that was ultimately such a huge headache.

For the people like me who also look into products before you buy I recommend not buying anything NZXT not based off of functionality but based off the fact that NZXT as a company is shady and outright trying to scam people through their website with bait and switch tactics on prebuilds and along with the fact that they raised prices before Black Friday and claim to be giving you a deal on Black Friday.

Andrew,US,"Updated Dec 24, 2024","Disappointments and HeadachesLet me start off by saying the support was good. On the other hand, the pc has been a disaster and very problematic over the past 3-4 years I've owned the pc. I have owned multiple pcs previous to this current NZXT build, and I have never had a single issue until I purchased this one.To start off, upon receiving the pc, the power cable fit loosely and thus my pc would frequently shut down due to the slipping cable. NZXT sent a replacement cable, and the replacement had the same issue. I purchased a new one from Amazon and tested a cable from a previous pc and both fit perfectly fine. This was weird but no big deal.The next set of issues I was experiencing was blue screens stemming from faulty ram. The ram was replaced by NZXT and solved the blue screens that were due to memory issues. Annoying, but again I thought it was no big deal.Other blue screens persisted and my pc would often times shut down randomly multiple times per day, and even shut down within seconds of being powered on. Was Windows causing the issues? This went on for weeks to months, then seemingly fixed itself. Then the cycle repeated and it continuously happened once again. I was told I had to do a fresh install of Windows, which obviously is not ideal since I would lose all of my files. I tried several things from my own research and eventually one of them seemed to fix the blue screen issue for good (knock on wood). I have no clue what the underlying cause of this issue was to this day.My next issue was my cooler stopped working after about 2 years. This caused frequent overheating and crashing. I had to purchase a new cooler myself to replace it. Coolers should last much longer than that. Without a doubt this damaged the CPU. I had to use the pc for work, so I had no alternative but to use the pc despite it hitting damaging temperatures with no programs running or just stop working. Some days, the pc likes to run very slow just to remind me that it has issues, likely due to the CPU cooler's failure.Currently, my pc likes to freeze every time I play any game. It will completely freeze and require a force shutdown with no pattern as to why. It may be instantly upon launching a game, or 30 minutes later. Without fail, it will freeze. I purchased this pc to play games and I can't even do that anymore. It feels like I  can't do anything without running into an issue, that is the reality of it. I have no clue why this occurs, but I am suspecting the GPU. Another issue separate from playing games is my pc randomly shutting down in general for no apparent reason (albeit this has become more infrequent). I am essentially just using this pc to browse the web at this point.Half the days I've owned this I've experienced an issue. There have been more blue screens with so many different error codes I cannot even begin to count it. I genuinely feel like I was scammed and was given a pc built from a rejected parts bucket. My friends joke that I purchased a lemon. The only non-problematic parts that I can verify is the case, fans, and ssd. I am sure I missed an issue or two. I wish I could have my money back or a replacement at this point, but it's far too late.Update:Order: 202666Tickets: 1958071 / 1717947 / 1664566 / 1024441 / 1474592Date of experience: December 19, 2024",1,Electronics

It came with Windows 11 Home activated and the license key is injected into the motherboard to make it easy to auto re-activate should you reinstall Windows on another drive. It seems to work well overall and is a clean build. Their support has been helpful as well.Some notable concerns:1. The GTX 4090 GPU did not have a support bracket to help hold the weight of the GPU; as heavy GPUs are strongly recommended to have. Thus you need to buy one and install it separately. Alternatively, just take the foam it comes with and cut off a chunk to hold up the GPU. The foam doesn't conduct static so it works well.2. Confirm all fans are working in your case. Mine had 1 cable knocked loose during shipping, which I resolved fairly easily in the back of the case. 3. The default/recommended case does not seem very good for airflow. I wish I knew that before buying it. But so far it seems sufficient. 4. (IMPORTANT) Be sure to undervolt your CPU by 0.05% in the motherboard BIOS (see a YT video for how). This will stop your CPU from throttling and getting too hot, while not impacting performance.Specs:CPU: i9-14900KFRAM: 64 GBGPU: 4090NVMe SSDs: 1 TB each, 2 SSDsFans seem inaudible to quiet while running.

Called and spoke with another person and was informed they were not upgrading my component because they had received my missing parts but in turn would pay for next day shipping. I was assured my order would be shipped next day. It has now been a week and a half and my order was just now shipped. I received tracking information and estimated shipping for an additional 7 days. This is ridiculous. I contacted NZXT and asked if this was a error. I was hung up on and my calls now no longer get answered. I called on another phone, spoke with another person and was hung up on after I gave my order number. Not how you should do business. Will not be shopping with NZXT again.

Emotinaloats,US,"Updated Feb 26, 2024","Nzxt motherboards are not worth the high priceI have an NZXT motherboard, and it's ridiculous! Especially at their price, you shouldn't have to install a separate CPU just to update the BIOS. I spent $1,500 on this build, and now I can't even use it.  At the very least, they should ship their boards with the latest BIOS installed. Because of NZXT's incompetence, I'm facing even more costs and delays.Worse yet, their customer service responses seem almost AI-generated.  From what I've read in other reviews, it's common for their cases to be missing standard parts like front panel connectors. Don't buy from NZXT – they're ridiculous! Their prices definitely don't match the quality of their products. This motherboard isn't worth $300. It's unacceptable that a modern 'high-end' board doesn't even have a BIOS flash button.To top it off, NZXT shipped me a faulty motherboard with a missing chip – a common issue, from what I gather. If I didn't know better, I'd think they're intentionally ripping people off, especially considering what I've seen on Amazon. Now, again because of NZXT's incompetence, my entire build is delayed. This motherboard should never have left the warehouse.Date of experience: January 30, 2024",1,Electronics

I'm disappointed in my experience with NZXT simply due to the lack of reasonable resolution offered. I purchased a custom built PC (a north of $3,000 PC) and when it arrived it was built in the wrong case. I quickly contacted support and was met with a friendly and seemingly helpful agent that apologized for the mess up and said he would start a support ticket for resolution. Their suggested resolution was to either give me a $70 credit and 3 RGB fans that was supposed to be in the case i ordered OR to return the PC and have me pay a restocking fee. Since this is not the case i wanted, i asked that recieved the credit, 3 fans, and that the other 4 fans in my case be replaced to match (less than a $100 request) and was quickly denied. This PC is for work and without it would be an issue, so sending this PC back and asking them to build me the correct one was much further of an inconvenience. Im writing this truly disappointed that a less than $100 request to mildly accommodate their error was denied on a $3,000 purchase.

The culmination of that conversation ended with the employee wanting to know if I wanted to cancel my order since they could not meet the demand, and delivery, and they did not have the proper equipment three weeks after I placed my order. Check a week later on 12/27 (tic#1848368), and still no clue about what the problem is, but gave me an estimated date of 1/5, and due to the problem, upgrade me to next-day delivery (separate from my $230 shipping). I try reaching out on 1/3 (tic#1856415) but I wait 2 hours and and there is no response or answer from their help team. I again try on 1/4 (Tic#1859122) and after 20+ min leave the chat.

My build was an AMD 7900X with 32GB DDR5 and a RTX 4080 TUF. I had originally asked them to ship the card separately because of risk of damage with the GPU being so heavy. They told me their packaging should suffice, and they denied my request and sent it out. As expected, the GPU was dead on arrival. I had to send the card back, they confirmed it was dead and sent me a new one. Fast forward about a year, my motherboard dies. They were pretty helpful, and got me a label printed out for shipped and asked me to send back the full PC. I explained what happened with the GPU and their packaging, and I requested to send the graphics card separately or not at all since the GPU was fine. They denied my request, again, to ship the GPU separately even though the issues was with the motherboard. Even with the immense amount of money this has cost them already, they just don't believe the GPU can be damaged in shipping for some reason. It's been a week, and they haven't even entered my PC into their repair queue yet. With that, they will send the PC back and I might even get a dead GPU again. They should allow the customer the option to ship GPU separately.Update: I should be getting the PC back today 8/5. They said it was as I expected, damaged during shipment and they had to replace the GPU, RAM, and motherboard. CPU also had issues. This was shipped back in their original packaging provided.

I was promised an expedited build process+shipping for them failing to adhere to the timeline they set henceforth, just for the shipping day to come and not get either of those promises.While NZXT has amazing products, they easily have the worst customer support system.This is in no way an attack on the wonderful people I spoke to in the phone, but the system they use as a whole.Just awfully bad customer service. I order a product well in advance for Christmas, just for it to not be schedule until almost the new year. If it wasn’t for the quality of product they pushed out, I’m sure few people would still conduct business with them on the scale of broken promises they send out.The best part is? They’ll send a generic response and ask for my ticket numbers, then do absolutely NOTHING to correct the situation.EDIT- Ticket #s: 1816912 1836710 1837701Update to the edit: They never reached back out, as I figured. It’s just a shame that the company with this quality of product (I did finally receive it, and I love it) just can’t seem to do right by the customers.Date of experience: December 19, 2023",1,Electronics
Gary,GB,"Updated Mar 13, 2024","Problematic build from NZXT fully refunded. I purchased an NZXT Player Two Prime (black case version) PC on Sat 24th Feb 2024. The PC was delivered on the 28th Feb 2024.On un-boxing:I had some initial concerns as there were packing materials on the inside of the PC tower.This included a rubbery polystyrene like piece, supporting the case end of the graphics card (possibly treated), a sticker on the AIO CPU Cooler, saying to plug in SATA before use, and a piece of cardboard over the internal fan, facing the Graphics card at the bottom of the case. Also they had forgotten to remove the statically attached film from the inside of the glass panel.On the black version of this NZXT case, the glass is a dark tempered type, making it very difficult to spot those packing materials. I called NZXT (I got through straight away), and I was told to ignore the sticker on the AIO Cooler as it was merely for protection during shipping.I was disappointed with the documentation provided with this PC, as there was no mention of this internal packaging, also all the other paperwork was just generic part assembly, no technical information on the actual components inside.Important Tips:If you buy this PC, please get yourself an anti-static wrist strap and cable that goes to a specialised wall plug (if your local mains supply has an earth).  I luckily already had this equipment costing me about £25. Also remove the outside plastic with the case sealed (not opened), and if there’s plastic on the inside, take the side panel into another room to remove it, and earth yourself again before going anywhere near the open PC case.This PC’s Specs as confirmed in the conformation email:CPU: AMD Ryzen™ 7 5800XGPU: NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 4070 Ti SuperMemory: 32GB (2 x 16GB) DDR4 3200 MhzStorage: 1TB NVMe M.2 SSDMotherboard: B550Cooler: NZXT Kraken 240 RGBPower: 750W GoldCase: NZXT H5 EliteSoftware: Windows 11 HomeParts verified by MSI Control Center (Software that I installed myself):Gigabyte B550 AORUS ELITE AX V22x 16 GB DDR4-2400, Unknown TEAMGROUP-UD4-3200Graphics: RTX 4070 Ti SUPER 16G VENTUS 2X Series, 16376 MBDrive: NVMe KINGSTON SNV2S1000G, 931.51 GBOn using this PC:It took me sometime to find software, that could tell me what some of the internal components of this PC actually were. (AIDA Extreme was pretty useless, as were most common tools.)I had seen that the MSI logo was printed on the RTX graphics card, so I thought I’d give MSI’s Control Center a go. I soon realised that the DDR 4 ram was not running at the proper speed.Both MSI’s software and Windows 11 reported a ram speed of 2400 Mhz, instead of the 3200 Mhz it was supposed to be running at.Prior to that discovery I had been running some bench tests using Cyberpunk 2077.When I compared this PC’s results to other 4070 Ti Super Graphics Cards, I noticed this MSI “RTX 4070 Ti SUPER 16G VENTUS 2X Series, 16376 MB"" ran 40 FPS slower than the MSI VENTUS 3X Model (refers to the number of fans) in an online comparison at 1080p.Then I noticed occasional texture issues, like a rippling or shimmer effect in the game, which did not occur on my old PC with an RTX 3060 Ti card installed, or online in any YouTube video. (A percentage of lower frame rates can be caused by using a comparatively weaker CPU, the rest of the poor performance was most likely the RAM not running at full speed.)A very minor niggle was that the “NZXT Kraken 240 RGB” is actually eject-able under Windows 11 USB, (there’s an unofficial guide online on how to fix this).Tip: I have a strong feeling this PC would look much better in white after seeing the black version. I found the black versions dark glass negatively impacted on the lighting inside (especially the coolers display), and with no lights on the graphics card or below it, I wasn’t impressed by it.Conclusion:I sadly had to return this PC for a refund, as I was unwilling to troubleshoot this PC given its price tag. I was sent an email with a pre-paid returns label (I had to print) to use via DPD’s drop-off service. It took slightly less than a week, after it’s arrival back with NZXT to be notified of my refund, and nearly a day and a half later it was back in my bank account.Date of experience: February 28, 2024",3,Electronics

BakeSmash,US,"Updated May 27, 2024","Very Poor ExperienceIt's been almost 3 months, 25 emails, 4 telephone calls, and I'm still waiting for my stick of RAM. The initial call was promising, quick, and painless. However, every subsequent interaction has been frustrating.1. Poor Communication:After the initial call, several confusing emails were exchanged about the status of my RMA. I was unaware that I needed to send the device in first, as this crucial detail was never clearly explained to me. It seemed like basic information that should have been communicated upfront. I have never done an RMA, for anything.2. Lack of Clear Instructions:After I shipped the one faulty stick of RAM, a month later, I discovered they expected 2 sticks. I guess they are grouped in pairs? Again, I had no idea. A simple instruction outlining what items needed to be shipped and the process moving forward would have prevented this misunderstanding.3. Delayed Responses:Each email exchange is taking several days, sometimes even weeks, for a response. This unnecessary delay drags out the entire process. I found myself waiting long gaps between emails just to understand the basic expectations.4. Inconsistent Follow-ups:Despite multiple calls to customer support, I am repeatedly told someone will reach out to me. However, no one does. I called and spoke to customer support three times so far, and each time, I was assured that someone would contact me. This has never happened, neither by phone nor by email.5. Warehouse Delays:After shipping the 2nd stick of RAM, I was informed of warehouse delays (Keep in mind, this is already 2.5 months into the interaction). Weeks have gone by without any updates, further prolonging the already lengthy process.6. Automated Emails:I received aggressive automated emails threatening to close my ticket if I didn't ship the part within a certain timeframe, despite already complying.After three months of waiting and continuous misunderstandings due to the lack of communication and clear expectations, I am over it. I even asked for my equipment back to purchase the new RAM myself. I'm sure it's cliche to say this is ""the worst customer service experience I've ever had.""... but that is all I can say at this point.NZXT: RA240291854Edit: NZXT, your generated response is a nice touch.

Sandy I,US,"Updated Dec 19, 2023","First and last time buying anything…12/19 - I just contacted FedEx and your company may still be able to expedite my shipment being that it’s still in their warehouse in California. Instead of responding with these automated “apologies”, why don’t you have someone from your team do the right thing and call FedEx!!! RESPONSE TO NZXT: multiple ticket numbers as I kept reaching out for someone to help me. Ticket numbers as follows: 1826629, 1834200, 1834515, 1834813. I begged and pleaded for the staff to help me. This was a gift for my son that I have not seen in 6 months, and he specifically requested this a PC from your site. As a business owner of 27 years, I’ve never hesitated to go above and beyond for my customers. It would’ve taken someone 5 minutes of their time to contact FedEx as I called FedEx several times as well, and they kept telling me the merchant had to call them. The experience with NZXT was very distasteful to say the least and to purposely not want to help your customer is appalling. First and last time buying anything from this site. Super delay in shipping the PC as I placed the order on November 24th. I contacted them a few times and explained that I needed it for Christmas. They shipped it out this morning with regular ground shipping with a delivery date after Christmas! I contacted FedEx and they informed me that the merchant still had time to call them and have the shipping changed. I literally begged these people to call FedEx and change the shipping, even offered to pay for the expedited shipping….kept getting the same response, “unfortunately, the time window has closed”. I’m telling them over and over that FedEx was willing to change the shipping with no empathy from these people. Putting your best foot forward and doing the bare minimum for your customers goes a long way, but instead you’re being connected to a “representative” that’s giving you generic BS responses. The best part about this company - if I want to go buy another PC to have in time for Christmas, they will charge me fees of roughly $250 to return the one purchased from them ;) Happy Holidays to the staff at NZXT!Date of experience: December 15, 2023",1,Electronics
Hybert,US,"Feb 27, 2024","Do NOT trust their pre-built PCsI was looking to build/buy a budget PC that had 3-4 DisplayPort/HDMI ports. I came across NZXT's pre built PCs and they immediately caught my eye. The Player: One is their cheapest option so I looked at that first. The GPU was a Geforce RTX 3050 and the images on their website didn't show the back of the PC so I decided to chat to them live.I started with the chat bot, who told me, ""The GPUs we offer for our pre-built gaming PCs typically have two to three DP (DisplayPort) connectors and usually a single HDMI connector. However, the exact number can vary depending on the specific model of the GPU.""Then, the bot sent me a link to their FAQ the also stated, ""In almost all of the GPUs we offer, they have two to three DP (DisplayPort) connectors and usually a single HDMI connector. Examples of these connectors are shown below.""JUST to be 100% sure, I left them an email asking how many DP/HDMI ports the Player: One PC would have and they said ""The PC usually comes with 3 DisplayPort and 1 HDMI connection on the graphics card. In rare cases, this can also be 2 HDMI and 2 DisplayPort connections, but we can not provide details about that before the PC is built, as the components can change based on our availability.""I was now CERTAIN that I would be getting 3-4 ports on my GPU, at least 2 of them would be DisplayPorts and the rest would be HDMI ports.Lo and behold, the PC I receive has 1 DisplayPort, 1 HDMI port, and 1 DVI port on the GPU. HUH??? After 3 sources told me one thing, I get something completely different???I was quite annoyed and contacted their support to see how this could get resolved. I asked if swapping the GPU for the correct one would be possible and they said no. I then asked for a refund and they said I would not get a full refund, and would have to pay for the assembly, shipping, and windows.So I don't get my money back because you lied to me about what I would be getting? You gave me something I did not buy which is extremely annoying because the ONLY reason I chose NZXT was because the price for the PC with the 4 ports on the GPU I needed was great, but it turned out to be a complete lie.I did not get what I paid for, and I now have to pay for what I don't even get!

Pat Garrett,US,"May 13, 2024","DO NOT BUY A PC FROM NZXT!!!!I know people don't read a lot of this but at least read the next part.There is a reason they aren't accredited by the BBB (Better Business Bureau) and have and F rating with a 1.36/5 star review. seriously go look.I bought a PC from then in August of 23. by December the pc started having overheating issues and in January I had to send it in for repairs. the customer service tech told me it would take 3-5 business days (that was a lie). there website said 7 business days (lie). 13 business days later my pc was finally being shipped back to me. they told me pc was damaged during shipping (lie). they said the case, gpu, cpu, and motherboard all had to be replaced. if all of those were damaged from shipping the odds of my pc even starting would have been astronomical let alone actually working pretty decently for 4 months. that's how I knew they were lying. So, I get my pc back and the end of January. now here we are 3 months later, and I am having issues with my gpu. talked to a customer service rep and asked to talk to a supervisor and they said one would contact me for the end of the day (lie) this was 05/09/24. the same customer service contacted me and said they would refund my initial shipping cost and I need to send my computer in to be fixed. a supervisor never contacting me, and I didn't ask the rep to talk to one for me. I replied asking for the info to send my stuff back and that I still wanted to talk to a supervisor. I have sense been ghosted and haven't heard anything back. It is blatantly clear this company only care about keeping their profit margines high and if you get send a dog water PC like I did they aren't going to fork over any money to actually fix it, they are just going to switch out the trash parts they used initially with even more garbage parts.My Advice:1. Don't buy a pc from NZXT (correct choice) 2. Buy a pc from NZXT (wrong choice) if you do buy a pc from this company make sure you get the largest warranty they have. Second, download OCCT (stress test/ benchmark program) and I would say run a test weekly to make sure your pc is running how it should be. Consider it like hoping on to your favorite game to do a weekly quest. hopefully this never happens to anyone else but when your pc starts failing test contact their customer support team and send it back to be fixed and if you have to keep doing that until your warranty expires. they clearly would rather spend more money fixing their own mistakes then to actually make a good pc from the start.Date of experience: May 12, 2024",1,Electronics

I feel like I'm being messed with intentionally, so I'm suppose to not use my computer whilst for now I have had week responses.

Finally got approved for RMA they received the aio last week on Wednesday which I confirmed via tracking but I never got an update as to whether they inspected it and we’re gonna replace it or fix it. So far every time attempt to actually get a response from NZXT has been overwhelmingly horrendous as they don’t respond back to support tickets at all and close them rather than respond to them I’ve politely asked for an update as to when the replacement might arrive. I’ve yet to hear a response at all as per usual when trying to contact them, even their listed phone numbers don’t work off their website and I even called today which is a Monday during the hours they stated to be able to reach them for help.

Jason Wilkinson,US,"Updated Dec 11, 2023","NZXT has horrible customer service and…NZXT has horrible customer service and the company does not stand behind its products. Instead, the company couches itself behind “proof of purchase” requirements before providing incomplete and incompetent assistance.I have purchased four different NZXT H1 systems. (Google for a review of the fire hazards associated with the case.) Due to craftsmanship issues the proprietary AIO has failed in two of four systems. While out of warranty, I offered to purchase new AIOs from NZXT, which I had done when a prior AIO failed 2 years ago. My attempts to contact customer service via phone  went unanswered, I attempted email. Those emails were  responded to in an untimely manner with a final “resolution” coming two weeks after my inquiry, informing me that out of warranty products cannot have parts purchased for repair.  Clearly, NZXT is not concentrated on the consumer market or customer service. Good riddance to a a poorly run organization. I will never purchase another NZXT product. I urge you to do the same.UPDATE 12/11/2023: I received an email from Trust Pilot indicating that NZXT was inquiring about my issue and required proof of contact utilizing email and/or reference number. I was informed that if I did not submit my reference number my review would be discarded within 3 days. This appears to be no more than gamesmanship, as any company worth their salt would have access to the database of consumer level emails concerning customer service. In addition, as noted in my primary review, response from NZXT took almost 2 weeks to respond to my email. Why am I provided 3 days? In any regard, My reference number: 1824699. I spoke to CSR Giada. CSR Giada closed my NZXT case at 7:22AM this morning 12/11/2023 shortly before NZXT contacted Trust Pilot.

Reached out to customer support and was told it was most likely a GPU error. I had to put down money to receive a replacement gpu and was refunded once I sent the old one back. Issues continue after receiving the new GPU. I finally decided to just ship my whole pc to them so they could take a look. They don't even attempt to run a game on the PC which is when the crashing occurred. Instead, they used a benchmark program and said nothing was wrong but decided to replace the GPU again. The same issues occur once again after getting the PC back. Sent the PC back to them for a second time and they actually ran games on my PC this time and said they had no issues but decided to upgrade my GPU anyway. Yet again I had the same crashing issues during my gaming. I asked to replace the whole pc but they said since they found nothing conclusive on their end they could not replace it for me. Waste of almost $5k and a waste of time I spent going back and forth with customer support. They have since removed the ""creator pc"" from their website and I have seen other reviews since then with this particular pc with the same issues. Looking to finally get a new pc but not from them.

Many thanks to them for doing so, hopefully the customer service team on first level contact can be trained so that situations like the one below don't happen to others.------------------Original Review Below----------------My water cooler failed, contacted them for support on it.That was 24 days ago,Juan took a full week to even reply to me at first.Second reply took a further 9 days!? despite me replying to them in 30 minutes each time they wrote with instruction or asking any question.By this time, I had to buy and install a new cooler obviously.Then after another 5 day wait, I get told the person i am talking to cannot actually help, so I get shunted to another person.Eric, who now wants me to do everything the first guy already had me do, but this time, I had to video it over-stressing the CPU and mobo until it caused a thermal shutdown or they wouldn't help.What exactly would this prove? I could just video the cooler not fitted in properly?I already had the new cooler I spent £100 on carefully pasted and installed, and was not about to overtemp my main workstation again.The pump has clearly failed.I was happy to pay to send the cooler back on an RMA so they could verify it had failed before replacement.Eric's response was that without a video, they wouldn't accept it and that was all he could do.Asked if i should just throw it away then as I cannot risk my computer, Eric just stopped responding.Date of experience: September 19, 2023",3,Electronics
T. Marie K.,US,"Sep 15, 2023","This company and their staff are useless and they sell crap products!!After extensive research on various gaming PC vendors, I ultimately opted for NZXT due to their appealing website and apparent expertise in the field. However, this decision proved to be a regrettable one. Despite paying $1800 and patiently awaiting the system's arrival for two weeks (in contrast to the advertised 5 business days), I encountered issues from the outset.My attempts to address these problems by submitting multiple support tickets went unanswered. Frustrated by the lack of communication, I decided to seek local assistance, incurring an additional cost of $100. It was during this assessment that I discovered the RAM installed in the system was faulty and non-functional, rendering the computer unusable.After yet another ticket submission, I received a response a week and a half later, acknowledging the RAM issue. To my dismay, I was informed that a replacement would only be sent once I returned the defective RAM. Consequently, I had to purchase new RAM from elsewhere, incurring an additional expense of $200 just to make the computer operational.My numerous attempts to contact NZXT's customer support team over the phone yielded no results. It became increasingly apparent that the company was indifferent to the fact that I had invested over $1800 only to be left with a non-functional device.Finally, after a two-month ordeal, NZXT agreed to send a replacement RAM module. However, they remained resolute in their refusal to reimburse me for the time and money wasted on fixing their poorly constructed system without their assistance. Frustrated by this lack of accountability, I had no choice but to initiate a chargeback.This experience has left me with the impression that NZXT provided a hastily assembled and inadequately tested system. Their indifference to my predicament, coupled with the prolonged resolution process, has been immensely disappointing.Date of experience: July 20, 2023",1,Electronics

Zayne Smith,US,"Sep 8, 2023","NZXT Customer Service experienceNZXT Customer Service experienceI purchased a prebuilt computer from these guys just over a year ago. Well I tried to turn it on about three weeks ago and it wouldn’t turn on. I called NZXT and they weren’t able to help diagnose the problem over the phone I needed to send it in to them to be looked at. Luckily I have a two year warranty so everything is great so far. The guy in the phone told me they would email me a shipping label and packing instructions to send the pc back for RMA. Well the label they sent me was a “test/sample” and fedex wouldn’t ship the pc. It took these guys over 48 hours to just get me a shipping label that works. I send the pc off and three or four days late I get an email from their RMA department asking me where my computer is. I had received an email from fedex the day prior showing the pc had been delivered.  I immediately call NZXT and am told they have no record of the pc being shipped. Well that’s because the incompetent employees overwatch there are trying to track a test/sample label they sent me instead of scrolling through the email chain and finding the correct label. When I call they can’t confirm they have my pc and at this point I have no idea where my computer is. They proceed to tell me “too not be concerned that they’ve lost my computer.”  Luckily they are just incompetent and can’t track the right label. We get that all figured out and they tell me someone will be in touch to let me know what’s wrong with my computer, what they’re going to do to fix it, and when I should have it back. This conversation occurred on August 28th. I email them on the 31st because I’ve noticed they put the wrong address on the shipping label( it has my old address as a return address). Nobody ever responds, of course. Fast forward to today and I haven’t heard anything from NZXT. I get a text from fedex saying my package is going to be delivered tomorrow?!? Well I go into the tracking and sure enough it’s my computer. I can tell because it’s coming from their address. I look at the details and of course they are shipping my computer to the wrong address. I reach out to NZXT and ask for an explanation and they basically say nothing. They tell me what’s wrong with my computer and when I ask why I was never communicated with and they didn’t feel the need to respond to my email there was no answer. My computer is supposed to show up tomorrow and I have zero faith it’s going to be fixed. TLDRBuy your computer from someone else.Date of experience: September 07, 2023",1,Electronics

Although not cheap it was a reasonably high end priced phone. After only about 2yrs the SOUND and speakers have just GONE! No sound, no speakers, no notification sounds, totally silent! No Cellular repair shops can figure it out and remedies on Internet have not worked. I was told I should buy another phone.It is likely the speakers are no good. I am left with little options. I will try to contact Ouikitel but I expect no positive aid, I have been  unsuccessful with past dealings with Chinese based manufacturers and sellers in the past. I strongly recommend that you do not purchase a product from Ouikitel. They advertise themselves to be a rugged darn near unbreakable phone and yet the sound and speakers are kaput after very little time and no incident which could have caused such a major setback.

I have sent messages asking for resolution to two very expensive and very broken phones for almost a year. Not once have I head from them! They only take your money and leave you hanging out to dry.

We used to have two wonderful phones from Kyocera and they worked perfectly. That was until Verizon decided to no longer support them and wanted an insane amount of money for newer models.The lesson learned from this is that there are no HONEST Chinese manufacturers and that one should not purchase any products from them directly. Find an honest vendor in another country and deal with them. Banggood and Oukitel are anything but honest. Yes, Banggood did respond initially but, they dropped out shortly after our problems began.

The first time, I purchased a C17 Pro and honestly very scummy business. 2/3 of the ""cameras"" on the device were FAKE and the speaker sounds like garbage. Recently I purchased a C21 Pro and all 3 cameras appear to be real and the company seems to be getting better over time but I find it very sketchy they have lied to customers in the past and used the classic Chinese fake camera scam. Not to mention their email support is non existant, they simply don't reply.Due to this sketchy past experience I cannot fully approve of this company but they seem to be getting better over years but that is no excuse to scam customers to get to the top and hope karma catches up with them.Certain device UI features could be improved to. They don't seem to fully polish things so I tend to run into small/big issues that are literally unfixable since they would require updates from Oukitel that will never happen. They seem to release new devices non stop which is probably a bad sign showing that they just water down their company with never ending devices they won't care for in the future.The company also appears to use ""giveaways"" to milk in more reviews from people who have clearly never purchased anything from them before.

Kyle Wright,GB,"Mar 12, 2023","Best Quality and Affordable Products on the MarketI'm sure those that complain about the Brand aren't really enthusiasts, I've had mine (WP9) for about a Year now and I can prove it with the recipe fromtheir Official Store on AliExpress (that's if Trustpilot ever allowed Image Uploads), but I digress.I haven't had any issues with my Rugged WP9 Model, it's Sturdy, Reliable, has plenty of storage (128GB), and is decently fast at multitasking, and I only spent like £90 for mine, I mean the Quality too Value is amazing. I intend too upgrade mine after a decade and also use it as a backup too.I even bought my Father one, though his is more Upgraded model with 5G and my Dad is very clumsy with devices, he breaks phones accidently as if they're toilet paper, but after 6 Months use his hasn't even broken or reduced in Quality.I even got my Fiancé one too, and same thing; still working and very fast, the Quality to Value of these produces is insane, I don't know how OUKITEL is managing too stay afloat business wise delivering these Quality Products at affordable prices. But it defiantly deserves recognitionDate of experience: March 12, 2023",5,Electronics

On contacting them they said they don't sell with these item. I have to buy these items separately. They don't say anything on the web page at all about this. So if you want the full package. BUY FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE. They were kind enough to send me a 10% discount on my next purchase which I tried to use on the items that were missing. And they said I can't use discount on these items.

William R.,US,"Mar 10, 2022","WP7 with torch and uv module.. no support?WP7 with torch and uv module. I did a lot of research , the modules , the night vision, I had to have it , rugged as well.. sold.Right out of box the charge port cover dropped off, I hated the fact the glass lenses were flush , the top one cracked , it did drop a few times but never run over by jeep like the ad. I tried my best to get the rubber back in but gave up think big deal not going swimming with it. This would haunt me when the super charger melted the charge port. It also changed notification and other very important setting on its own.  Airplane mode, sound off, volume down, phone notify off,  Google voice forget it changed everyday.  Got to be real pain when your doing it with 20 apps. I went through whole android switch map. hard reset .. no change. I thought upgrade to ten better then trip to china, but warranty was coming up fast and upgrade difficult. I put it 7 tickets all were ignored last August both before and after warranty expired plus emailed support all ignored. Try again tonight.. took pics sent order number bought both modules..I don't expect them to cover all expense but they could swap it with refurb. or something. Ill pay ship.  They wont even talk to me. I find it hard to believe that web form could be broke that long. Ignore support email as well? I'm sys-admin forget it.  Now I'm stuck with a $800 give or take brick. With torch light and uv sterilize modules useless.  Repair looks daunting and expensive on YouTube. Trip to china, ugh what do I call with?  ill try to call American distributor first. Its a beautiful phone. It does take nicks with light usage, some feature like proximity failed on mine but major things like night vision does work well. If it worked as advertised I give 5 stars but with problems and no support and brick..phone not ringing when people call.. big issues. perhaps they see this and contact that be nice.Date of experience: March 10, 2022",1,Electronics

Since the price was reasonable, I bought the smartphone. Today, December 29th, 2023, my cell phone fell from the couch table onto the floor (carpet). When I picked it up, I noticed that a crack had formed across half of the smartphone. How can that be ? The table is 35.5 cm high and the floor is carpeted. The smartphone is supposedly designed for outdoor use and is equipped with Gorilla Glass. Sorry but I literally feel ripped off... My old smartphone,  Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite without a protective case withstood more and is definitely not an outdoor smartphone. In my opinion this can only happen if there is a huge quality problem within the production of the phone. What can we do about it since i assume it isnt waterproof and dustproof anymore? Attached you will find the pictures i made right after the fall. Yours sincerelyDate of experience: January 23, 2024",1,Electronics

This is so funny because if they cannot unlock your phone, would you trust them to unlock another device? They first do a check, which is 26 GBP, to see whether they can unlock a phone or not, and they then charge you again another 25 GBP for unlocking. Then, the unlock is not instantaneous. It will take them days to unlock, and even after many days have gone past, they will not be able to unlock and issue a credit note instead of getting your money back. PLEASE STOP USING THEIR SERVICE.

Bill,US,"Jan 10, 2024","I strongly advise against using this…I strongly advise against using this service. Their website claims that once a device is unlocked, it stays unlocked permanently. However, my experience tells a different story. I had 8 iPhones, all on a reseller flex plan, which were temporarily unlocked by CellUnlock. Unfortunately, about a month later, each iPhone relocked, this time to a minor carrier. Despite numerous emails and attempts at resolution, the issue remains unsolved. Now, all these iPhones are essentially useless, locked to a carrier with no available unlocking options. While they did refund the service fees, there was no further compensation for the significant inconvenience caused. Please be wary - even if your device is initially unlocked, there's a high chance it might relock.Date of experience: November 18, 2023",1,Electronics

Jeremy Wilkinson,US,"Updated Nov 7, 2022","Over 3 months no codes! No refund to be seen yet. Had to dispute chargesOrdered unlock codes for two devices at the end of July. Still do not have my codes. I've used them in the past countless times and they were great! This time around, I keep getting a run around. One order was 1-10 business days, the other was 1-48 hours. Customer service responds, but with a new excuse and time frame each time. Last email they said another 1-2 weeks! Absolutely ridiculous.Order numbers 4044797 and 4044812. Still waiting, don't want a refund, want the codes I paid for over a month ago. I've talked to Dhorris numerous times, she is generally not very helpful and passes on vague information like ""we're working on it"".After over a month of waiting for any response other than ""there are global delays"" or ""it's processing"" I did request a chargeback. To which they refuted with my bank. The review is in no way disingenuous, I was not ever told that attempts were not successful rather that there were delays and it should just be a few more days or another week. Ridiculous.3 months later still have no refund! Had to dispute charges. Beyond angry.Date of experience: August 28, 2022",1,Electronics

Rob ,GB,"Updated Sep 5, 2021","Questionable 24/7 customer support. Software potentially malicious04/09/2021:Didn't receive order in estimated time scales so I thought I would contact their 24/7 support team. Turns out they interpret 24/7 as a phone line only open 6-22 Mon-Fri and an email address they take up to two days to respond. If I had known that the order would not have been within their timescales (currently not yet fulfilled) and their customer service was not 24/7 I would have ordered from elsewhere.Update 05/09/2021:Received link for unlocking software today. This software was detected as containing the known trojan ""Win32/Tnega!ml"" and was blocked by windows defender. I've requested a full refund.Update 05/09/21 2 (Following Cellunlocker.net response):When attempting to use the software I actually received two warnings.The first warning was that it was an unsigned piece program which is understandable as it's a small volume piece of software and the developer may not be able to justify the ~$200/yr cost of a software publisher certificate. This is an understandable decision and was a risk that I would have been willing to accept.The second warning was that a section of the code matched with a known malicious program and Windows Defender automatically quarantined the program. There may well be a legitimate reason for this, however to me this is an unacceptable risk and I would strongly advise anyone not to bypass this level of protection in Windows Defender as it puts their computer (and any data on that computer) at severe risk. Ultimately you may have a different approach to risk however that is my view.I also want to add that I do not believe that cellunlocker.net are acting maliciously, however distributing software (particularly if it is of a third party origin) carries the potential to inadvertently share malicious software and I am not convinced they have taken the steps necessary to ensure it is safe.I've currently asked for a refund in an email sent to both the support and sales email addresses and I will update the review once it is processed.Update 05/09/21 3 (Following Cellunlocker.net response):Final update hopefully! Cellunlocker.net issued the refund immediately after their last update which PayPal have confirmed. As a result I've increased the review from 1 to 2 stars. Whilst the issue has been resolved I believe it is important to keep the review online as I believe the following information would be useful to future customers:1) Whilst I have had quick responses today, I do not believe their typical email response time and call center/online chat opening hours meet the standard I would expect from ""24/7 support available""2) If anyone is purchasing software it is important they understand the risks associated with unsigned software packages. There are ways this can be mitigated such as installing the software in a sandbox or virtual machine so it can be checked for viruses without putting their computer at risk. Obviously this is likely to be beyond the capabilities of a typical customer so they may want to consider alternative options. I imagine most customers are looking for a simple unlock code. In this case the risk is minimal as the worst case is that the code will simply fail to unlock their mobile. However if they are looking for a software unlocking option, it is important they understand and consider the risks above.Note to cellunlocker.net:Please may you ensure you do not include any personally identifiable information (such as my email address) in your public response as you have done so with other customers.Date of experience: September 04, 2021",2,Electronics

I have placed an order with them for unlocking my phone on the 17th of August !!!! Still to this date I haven't received the service nor a refund. Every time I contact them about the refund they tell me to wait for a few more days. WHAT A JOKERS. I don't normally write reviews but enough is enough.Update 10/24.So first of all these clowns are trying to take my review down, then they demand me to update the score which If I could I would change to 0 stars.So I have been in touch with them for 4 times during so called unlocking process. First time I was just asking for an  idea how long it was going to be. Second and third time I was just reminding them that I was still waiting. On the fourth time I had lost all my hopes and demanded them for a refund or Ill go on trustpilot and to my  bank. Guess what, it didn't look like they cared about me. All the times I was in touch with them I got the same answer, ""give us more time, we are working on it"". I must say the magic worked after chatting with them on the last time, the following day email turned up saying that my phone has been unlocked. Happy days you would say. There is just one problem I no longer have the phone, being fed up with these guys I had returned it to the seller so I don't end up with the phone that I cant return and it cant be unlocked.

Glen W,US,"Feb 7, 2023","Treated like a CEO, but actually just an end userThe service / process itself was easy to get started and easy to follow along the progress. The part I appreciated the most was working with Rob H and Jonathan S. The 2 of them worked with me on the project timeline.  Even though I am an end user, the data was stored on a Windows server with RAID10 array and was important to me. I didn't realize the BU plan had stopped working. My entire document and picture store was in that box and has been for many years.  I was in the middle of purchasing a home when my server crashed taking all of my data with it. I sent the drives in but needed to delay the processing of the order. They held everything for me until I was ready to proceed. It was truly a pleasure to work with them, and the responsiveness to any of my problems and questions were great. Once I was ready to go, the data was recovered and back in my hands.  Thanks so much for making the entire process smooth and worry free.Date of experience: January 31, 2023",5,Electronics
Clint Brown,US,"May 20, 2024","Be careful when using Ontrack for Data…Be careful when using Ontrack for Data recovery!  I had a Mackbook air that was unresponsive.  Since I work at an engineering firm, I had a few of the electrical engineers look at the laptop and they were able to diagnose the problem to a shorted BGA chip.  I decided to send the laptop to Ontrack before trying to fix it so I don't risk loosing my data.  Ontrack had the laptop for about 10 days and replied that they were not able to recover the data nor the laptop.  when I received the computer back, there were missing components on the logic board and Ontrack had drilled holes in the PCB rendering the computer completely unrecoverable, even if I decided to send it to another data recovery vendor.  Since their model is ""we don't get paid until we recover your data"", I believe Ontrack rushed the diagnosis and went straight to invasive techniques without notify me that ""if this fails your computer will be unrecoverable"".

Lori,US,"Jul 4, 2021","Will never go anywhere else!!Learned about Ontrack from my local repair shop. My hard drive had been dropped and was in the worst possible shape for repair or data recovery. Best Buy quoted me $1500 and that was only if I paid a $50 non-refundable assessment fee, shipped it out, and waited to hear back. Ontrack pays for you to ship the item to them, reviews and assesses the problem, and sends you a quote. Then you decide if it makes sense to you. As this hard drive had 15+ years of work and photos on it, I was thrilled to find out that not only did they feel confident they could recover my data, they were able to do it for much less than a chain store with an overhyped name. I would like to say I would have paid anything to get my data back, but the reality was that I could not afford what I thought it might take. And while it still cost a great deal, the process and the trust I had with Ontrack was worth every penny. I would use them again in a heartbeat and will recommend them to everyone I know.

Alexandru Calugaru,GB,"Dec 1, 2021","Incompetent or thieves, difficult to decide.I don't know where all this good reviews are coming from. I have sent my SSD drive to them for a free valuation. After they've evaluated the drive, informed me that there's severe damage and I have to pay another £160 for them to give me the list files that could be recovered which would have costed another £1400. Overall £1600, on case of urgency more than the double.After paying the £160, I have been informed that the drive is not recoverable. Which brings me to the conclusion that they are either incompetent (couldn't recover or identify the problem) or thieves. Either way you would prefer to keep away from them. if by any chance you'll be asked money for additional survey, don't waste your money, they either don't have a clue or want to steal at least something for doing nothing.Maybe my review might look a little too harsh, but it's based on a real experience, where they actually had to deal with a real issue. Probably most of the other cases could have been solved with a data recovery software, cause I don't think they are capable of actually recovering anything. Probably the money for the survey was to send it to other company that actually can do the job: (tried to recover data with the data recovery software and when failed sent me a message that additional survey is required, they had to send it to proper recovery company). Well i have already tried the software recovery before sending it.Maybe it's better to ask who they use for data recovery and go directly to the other company that actually does the job.Date of experience: December 01, 2021",1,Electronics

m1t4cpp,CA,"Feb 15, 2022","Deliver what they claim, efficient service, and available to track progress onlineI had superb experience engaging ONTRACK Data recovery Brisbane. My 3.5 years old Seagate Backup Plus Hub was suddenly unreadable from any laptop on a Sunday afternoon. I spent a few hours that evening researching potential reputable data recovery companies based in Brisbane. Honestly, ONTRACK was my 2nd choice, just because its location was rather secluded and one negative review that I read on Google. Having said that, ONTRACK was the only one that could do the work due to its affiliation to SEAGATE and may have the right tools to deal with any SEAGATE hard disks. I was informed about this detail from the first company I went to (thank you to the director). I phoned ONTRACK on Monday and spoke to Michaella briefly about my issues. I made an appointment to drop off right away. I was thankful that I was allowed to come with my hard disk in person, unlike the third company that I contacted. She was very efficient in communicating what I need to know about the process, gave me the form to fill in, and confirmed with me orally if my data was that value due to the minimum potential cost that may incur. I was glad for this extra gesture of her. Having heard of how valuable my entire data was, she took me seriously and explained all the detailed processes that would happen. What she said was the same as what was stated on the website, which I spent a couple of hours before reading it. She also ensured me for the policy of “no data, no fee” and that I didn’t have to pay any down payment during my drop-off. I half knew that it was a long shot to get all my data back as the first company I talked to mentioned how serious the damage was. Within the next 24 hours, I was informed that the damage was indeed severe and ONTRACK openly said they couldn’t commit to recovering those data and that they needed more than a week. They asked me if I still wanted to proceed and if I wanted to commit the payment required cost shall any data be recovered. I said yes to the pay and the waiting time. I certainly know that it was a kind of complex recovery process. Hence, I understood why it cost me that much. Long story short, I was informed about  73% of my data was recovered 10 days later. They gave me a link to virtually check and ask questions before making a total payment online. I am also glad about this opportunity. It meant that I can see what I would get before transferring money. I took the time to check and seek confirmation. Michaella answered my concerns promptly. Once payment is done, I got back my data in the new external hard disk (included in the cost) within a couple of hours. Also, ONTRACK provided you with an online account where you can always check the engineers’ progress, so you would know what has been done to your damaged product at any given time. This feature gave me so much peace of mind and I could manage my expectations well. Thank you engineers for all your efforts.Date of experience: February 15, 2022",5,Electronics

varinab,MA,"Sep 15, 2023","WARNING: the diagnosis report means nothing: I paid over $1000 to receive corrupted, unusable files that were deemed ""good"" by the Company.I needed to recover a little bit less than 1tb of data from a dropped HDD. Most of them are photos, with a few PDFs and TXT files here and there. I sent the HDD to Ontrack, as it was the company recommended by the disks manufacturer. I already knew that I would spend several hundred euros and had no problem doing so because the files I wanted to retrieve were important to me. I paid the 250 euro fee to have a diagnostic, which is absolutely fine. Communication was good, but the turnaround time stated on the website is bogus, so be prepared to wait a long time. Almost 1.5 months later (instead of the 5-7 days they mention) I received a detailed diagnostic that stated that almost all of my files could be recovered. Over 250 thousands files were green, aka ""good"", ""100% retrieved"", with ""NO STRUCTURAL or READ errors"". 1500 other files were deemed ""yellow"" or ""red"", so either completely corrupted or partially retrieved, so might not open.The report lead me to believe that most of my files had been saved. I was over the moon with happiness! I gladly accepted the invoice and paid over 800 euros.I received the disk two days later, and got a nasty shock: 99% of the green/ok/good files are actually corrupted. You've read that right. The files with ""no read error"" or ""structural errors"" cannot open.Basically, and this is absolutely crazy, there is ZERO difference between the ""partially retrieved"" files that I was warned might not open, and the""good"" files that were supposed to be 100% retrieved. The ""good"" files cannot be opened, and if they can, which is the vast minority of them, it is missing half of its data (for example, photos are half black, or the text turned into gibberish) making it completely useless. The report I paid 250 euros for was therefore not only useless, it was false, which is criminal for a company that claims they are the best in their field. The green files do have ""structural"" and ""read"" errors, contrary to what was told in the report. If I had known, I wouldn't have paid several hundred euros. Why would I pay over 1000 euros to receive useless files? What a joke.What I paid for is basically a drive full of unusable files. What is the point of the $250 diagnostic then? Isn't it to let you know which files will work so you can actually decide if paying several hundred to get them is worth it? So I send an email to the agent I've been talking with, and crickets... They no longer answer. Funny, they were very responsive when I hadn't payed yet, calling me on the phone, responding to my emails almost immediately. And now, they are nowhere to be found. You have 1 month to ask for help after the disk has been sent and they make sure to not answer so that time runs out on you. Despicable practice.I've been completely misled by Ontrack because no one in their right mind would pay that much to receive corrupted files. I'm flabbergasted. I could have gone to any local repair shop and got the same result for for not even 1/5 of the cost.Date of experience: September 01, 2023",1,Electronics

Hopefully they go under soon and make the world a better place, where packages get delivered on time, where employees won’t lie to your face and where “end of business day” doesn’t mean 9pm!If you actually want your package delivered, in one piece, and on the agreed upon day you should steer clear of this scam company. We have had their drivers get lost and actually take a package home with them, after marking it delivered, and come back the next day (a Saturday) in their personal car to deliver it. Can we say theft?! We have video of their driver lobbing packages out the side door of their hoopty, throwing packages over a fence that were marked fragile. The list goes on and on. I swear, if OnTrac told me it was raining hundred dollar bills outside I would get a second opinion before wasting my time going to look. Needless to say, they earn their one star rating.

I stupidly didn’t back up my phone, it wasn’t very old so I assumed it was ok. I had recently set up icloud for my photos but before I could move my images (over 10,000 of them) the iphone 8 complained there was not enough storage and suddenly itunes popped up with error 14 and the phone literally wouldn’t switch-on. I took it to a local phone repair shop and they said the only option was a factory reset, I just couldn’t believe it, all my photos would be lost forever. However, I got in contact with Robin England at Ontrack and he and the team in the US have worked on my phone for the best part of 10 months. Yesterday I was given a drive with all my data – pictures, videos, messages, contacts, everything I thought was lost forever. As I understand it, this is the first time anyone has been able to recover data due to this error – the team at Ontrack have gone above and beyond to help me, and I cannot recommend them highly enough. Thanks to their determination to find a fix for this error they have saved my many, many, years of memories that were irreplaceable. Safe to say I have now backed them up. Please, if you have a problem like this contact Ontrack – the team are amazing 😊Date of experience: April 14, 2021",5,Electronics

I have owned a company that developed a software solution with a large software development staff of over 20 people, for the wholesale retail industry. I trust one can understand of having dozens of software personnel who developed this solution through  the directions of input from 100's of customers over 30 years of time  was very costly. In fact given all it is priceless. My situation was that I had my software backed up on all types of media, including 5 tower units. Last december 2019 I lost everything I own to a fire. The only item not disintegrated was a half melted tower computer that I had to pry apart with a crowbar as the case was melted by the intense heat. I did get the scorched drive out and send it to ONTRACK. I can tell you as a IBM reseller for over 30 years, my experience in the industry that these people our  simply the best. The recovered all my software at a very reasonable price. I trust that anyone can understand their is simply no words of appreciation that can express the blessing of getting my software back. I am hopeful that I may be able to sell my solution which will be a financial beneficial facture in rebuilding my home. SHould anyone out their have a similar situation look no further. call ONTRACK.

Susana  Rodriguez,US,"Mar 12, 2021","AMAZING COMPANY!!!!!!I was soooooo Lucky to have decided to get a second opinion. I am a photographer and my Western Digital 4TB was deemed inaccessible In October 2020. I had 8 weddings that had not been  given to the brides and 2 of them had not even seen their photos. I was desperate and sent my drive to first a company in Montana called FILES SAVERS DATA RECOVERY . On November 12th, 2020 FILES Savers said they had good news and it was that they said that they could recover my data and the bad news was it would be $2400.00. I would call them on a daily basis and all they can say is that it was a Firmware problem. They said it all the way till February 8th, 2021. What triggered me to get the 2nd opinion is because one of my brides sent me an email stating that it was Unacceptable to wait so long for their photos. So On February 9th, 2021 I asked the company to please return my drive but never told them that I was sending it elsewhere so they would not sabotage my drive in anyway shape or form. On February 11th, 2021 I received the drive back and sent it out to THE AWESOME ON TRACK DATA RECOVERY on February 12th, 2021 they then received it on February 15th, 2021 and they started the recovery as I even paid the extra $100.00 so I did not have to wait 10-20days more . On February 16th, 2021 I called in the late afternoon and spoke to Ashley she was so fabulous and funny , because she knew I was very stressed with this situation. She stayed with me on the phone and sent Mr. Adam Mergen (THE ENGINEER) an interoffice email about my drive and at this point he had told her he had 90.1% of my data. Then February 17th,  in the afternoon I received a message stating there was 99.8% of my data was retrieved. At this point I was very ecstatic and happy. They then sent me the invoice I paid it and a Brand new 2tb  drive was sent out to me on February 18th and received February 19th, 2021. ON TRACK IS AMAZING!!!!!!!! They recovered 90, 717 photos. This is the best move I've ever made and all my brides have all their photos.

They arranged collection of my faulty drive then analysed the damage. I received a report that provided the estimated data recovery percentage and then the option to proceed or cancel (with no costs incurred). I chose to proceed. I was set up a login to their own portal where I could monitor the progress of the job and read the reports they produced regarding the data loss. The recoverable data was copied from the faulty drives image and sent to me on an external hard drive. I asked if this could be swapped for a SATA drive so it to go back in my PC which OnTrack arranged and delivered with no hesitation. If you require this, I would suggest making it clear to OnTrack at the beginning to save the few extra days it took for the collection and redelivery. Amazing service.

I did luckily with Ontrack have a positive and excellent outcome. The service and communication with Lucy & Simon and rest of the team through to early hours of the morning was second to none and beyond excellent.

After waiting several weeks, a ""technician"" left a vague voicemail that they could not recovery the data and would be shipping the iphone back.  No report or explanation of why it took so long or why  they were unsuccessful was ever provided. Now Apple says they can not warranty the iphone because of internal damage caused by previous attempted internal work.

I held on to the drive just in case because I had pictures on the drive that I couldn't replace and I didn't have the heart to throw the drive out. After I put my cat to sleep due to cancer and haven't been able to return to the US to see my children due to the Coronavirus, I was even more determined to see if the pictures on the drive could be recovered and so we put our trust into Ontrack and we weren't disappointed with the results. Not only did they recover ALL of the pictures on the drive but all of my documents as well. They were able to recover 90% of the drive. I can't begin to even express how happy I am that we put our trust into their ability to recover the drive. The service was above what we expected! I can't recommend their services enough to someone who doesn't have the heart to throw away a hard drive because of some remote possibility that one day it may be able to be recovered.

I am less satisfied with my communications with office staff.  In the case of the successful job #2, I received emails from three different individuals at OnTrack and would have preferred to communicate with just one person.  Of these three individuals, two made errors that I was able to quickly correct by writing back promptly.  One egregious error was in the final billing, which was incorrect -- too high (in favor of OnTrack).  The other error had to do with OnTrack waiting for my shipment, which had already arrived at OnTrack a few days earlier.

Wdk,ES,"Jul 26, 2023","Unprofessinal Company. Do not use.Do NOT use this company. Their refund policy is trash. If you are not sure about the theme you want you have no chance for refund. Many other companies offers refund so I suggest going with another company than Zemez. I installed the theme and I didnt like it all. Hard to work with, problems and time consuming. I gave up after a day trying it and then bought another theme from another company and finished my site in a day.But they still wouldn't refund me even days after the purchase so 169 usd in the trash.

Manfred Kraus,DE,"Jul 25, 2023","Zemez theme and Zemez support can only be recommended...In the beginning I had tried free theme for my Shopify store until I decided on a theme. When I wanted to buy a license of the selected theme from Zemez, I unfortunately bought it on an unauthorized site and had problems with the optimization of the site.Since the support of the unauthorized site could not help me and I came across the website of Zemez by searching for support on the web, I asked Zemez for support and learned that I bought a theme without a license.  Since I have businesses and I didn't want to use an unauthorized license, I purchased a license of the theme from Zemez and installed the theme in my Shopify store.For any question that arises about the theme, I have received a response from Zemez support with the solution. Also, when deciding which variant of the theme is best to use, I was given excellent advice by Zemez support, not only with a recommendation but also with the reason why to use this proposed theme. What stands out above all is that with the reply emails I received not only the text but also screenshots with explanations. The theme from Zemez and the support from Zemez can only be recommended.Date of experience: July 25, 2023",5,Electronics

I was informed of the price of $108, however, upon completion of the purchase, I saw that $165.98 was debited from my account. There was no indication on the checkout page that this was the cost in AUD, and even Template Monsters support did not state this. When I needed help with any support questions, the only option available was to create a ticket and wait three days. I brought this issue up with Shopify, as I wanted to be sure it was not my own fault, and received a quick response as they stated it was theme issues not Shopify after all Shopify is the biggest platform in the world. My customer experience has been unpleasant, and from what I have seen, many others have had a similar experience. Your theme has major issues and your customer service should be available 24/7 for customers all over the world. Chat options should be available to provide quick responses, rather than waiting nine hours for a reply. Due to this experience, I request a full refund as soon as possible. You have not only taken my money, but also my time. I would appreciate swift action in this matter.Date of experience: December 20, 2022",1,Electronics

My latest request was where I needed help in changing something in CSS that I could not straighten out myself. Whereas most of my service requests have involved tweaking, there were many times in the beginning of using the Monstroid2 Template that I just needed help in understanding the template which is very user friendly. There were several times that what I thought was simple turned out to be not so simple. So instead of solving the problem using chat, a job ticket was opened and in a short period of time I got the answer(s). This is a company that you can rely on for 24/7 support.
