We re-connected on Jan 3 and determined that with her advocacy on my behalf, Aflac approved the policy w/o a follow-up, which was good news.  I understand business processes can grind to a halt over the holidays, so I accept that as a reasonable explanation and give credit to Sahara for her persistence, and ultimately helping to get my policy approved.  Hence, my views have changed reflecting a good outcome, However, there are lingering concerns about how Medicare people are treated in general by the private insurance companies, which frequently compromises decisions made by MDs to provide health care and may trigger negative impacts upon Medicare people by these private insurers providing supplemental coverage. Unfortunately, the agents at UMA are caught in the middle. But on the whole Sahara Rice was courteous, professional and as efficient as she could be in the context of holiday hindrances, and the frankly failed system of private health insurance in the USA.

This was my 2nd order with them since my 14 year daughter started wearing contacts a few months ago.   My daughter had a special event for this weekend. We had been asking her about her contacts and she kept telling us she had plenty.   Well Sunday night 5 days before the event she tells us she only has 2 of the left eye/RX  none for the right.  We immediately placed an order, and requested that whatever upgrades could be done we would pay.    They responded first thing Monday morning that they would upgrade and get them out ASAP.   Then that afternoon I got a message saying they had to order out for the contacts and I knew then they weren't going to make it.  Well around lunch time Tuesday, I get an email saying your order has shipped and is coming 2 day FEDEX.  We had the contacts on Thursday afternoon.  Unfortunately her event was cancelled as a result of the winter storm in the south, but just the fact that they did all of this to ensure we had what we needed.   This type of customer service exist slim to none these days.   They have made me a long term customer. I am just so pleased with them.   Date of experience: January 01, 2025",5,Pharma

Mark Schmunk,US,"Oct 5, 2024","These guys are legit!I recently purchased contacts from OptiContacts.com, and the entire experience was great!I was a bit hesitant due to some of the reviews expressing concerns about the expiration dates, customer service, etc., but I can tell you all was good.  The contacts may have expired a bit before other sources, but way beyond what you would wear them for anyway.  i.e. you should wear them within six months and they expired years in the futureI was also skeptical about their prices.  They were lower than about anyone else I could find, so I thought there could be problems.  However it was just the opposite.  I did have an issue where my doctor gave me the wrong PX, but OptiContacts was great about refunding my money on the unopened boxes and were quick to help me get the right ones.This may sound like a fake review, because it is all good, but I can tell you it is totally legit.  Actually, I rarely take the time to do a review, but this experience was so good, I felt I needed to.I have found a source for all my contact needs as long as they are in business, and continue with their competitive pricing and outstanding customer service.Date of experience: October 04, 2024",5,Pharma

Julie G.,US,"Dec 13, 2024Verified","Meds work as they should for a crazy good price!     I love ordering my generic Imodium from Wellspring Meds. Their prices are consistent, as is the fact that they always have at least one bottle size. This is very important to me since the Metformin I have to take affects me  in a very negative way. It's critical that I keep a decent stock of my anti-diarrheal meds.      The company ships quickly, and with free shipping (I'm pretty sure. lol). I recieved my meds within 1½ weeks from order date; if not sooner. The generics work just as good as name brand. The other nice thing about Wellspring, is that their generics are way way way cheaper than the generics in stores.     The only downside...too many stinkin' ad emails! Still worth patronizing this website. My card numbers are safe and they've got a huge variety of meds & supplements. Well done guys!Date of experience: December 03, 2024",5,Pharma

He placed a support ticket and I did not think anything would happen. I checked the Let's Get Checked website a few days later and I was able to schedule the biometric screening! Ki called me a day or two later to check in and inform me this was resolved. I greatly appreciate his assistance and follow up call!

A few hours later they wrote & said they were out of stock & would refund me WITHIN 30 DAYS. This is an extremely large refund window so I checked my bank card statement and saw they had claimed my payment in the name of LaunchGiftCards, same initials as Letsgetchecked but not the right company name. I suspect fraud. Update: I sent Letsgetchecked a screenshot of the payment confirmation to LaunchGiftCards from my bank statement. They said it was malware from my phone and nothing to do with them. My bank statement this morning now showed Letsgetchecked as the recipient of my payment. I have since written asking where my refund is, and they are ignoring my emails.

Lola was the only brand thinking about its consumers and our safety and comfort. I have used their tampons, liners, pads, and period underwear. Lola has been consistent with its quality of its products and have only improved from there. I was able to pause my subscription while I was pregnant which was great to not have to think about and keep clicking ""skip next order"" lol! I have also followed the company for years and have seen their efforts to increase accessibility to its products and reflect on whether they are being inclusive in the representation within the company.

Erin B.,US,"May 18, 2021","Shredding TamponsI really wanted to like these tampons, as I’ve become allergic to the brand I had been using my whole life thus far. Unfortunately, these just weren’t a good fit. They are bulky and don’t absorb much beyond the outside edges of the tampon. The applicator is nearly impossible to get right on the first try without having to pull the whole thing out and start over. However, the worst part was that the tampon shredded apart when removing, leaving part of it inside. My very kind boyfriend had to dig out the remaining piece.

I experienced a lot of friction. Never happened with the previous brand i used. When i pulled out the applicator from down there, i noticed the open edges had pulled few strands from the tampon.

Let's start with the tampons: (1) The plastic applicator is bulky and often comes apart while you are trying to insert it. (2) There's no lock/ click so even when you do insert it, you may not know it is fully in. (3) The cotton filler is also huge. I won't describe what it feels like inside of me but suffice to say it's extremely uncomfortable. (4) The string seem too thin and thus is hard to find when one needs to remove the tampon. (5) They don't seem to last as long as competitors. The pads have issues too. (a) They do not absorb as advertised, which can cause an embarrassing situation. (b) The pads adhesive don't stick, which also causes leaking. I love the idea behind these products - 100% cotton, eco-friendly, women owned.

Nothing changed the outcome. The rest of the tampon will not have hardly any blood on the outside. I've not had this experience with cheaper tampons in the past which have nice thick cotton strings. I wanted so badly for these to work as I want to keep bleach and excess chemicals away from my body, but these work worse than dollar store tampons.

But these are terrible, and I will never repurchase. The applicator is terrible, and as someone who has been using exclusively tampons for years, I am incredibly frustrated by them. I’ve tried many brands and have NEVER had issues when inserting tampons until these. Not to mention the applicator has sharp edges after the product has been applicated which pinch and pull. Further, I’ve NEVER had pain inserting tampons before. Ever. But these are horribly uncomfortable. For some reason (and I am just using the regular size, so they aren’t too large) they are horrible painful to apply and caused me terrible pain for the first hour upon wearing them. I will also mention that they leaked more than other products I’ve used. I was excited for a better option, but I’d rather have chemicals than severe discomfort for a week which is already awful for me due to my endometriosis.Date of experience: October 18, 2020",1,Pharma

Esther Gonzalez,US,"Oct 16, 2020","I recently purchased Lola tampons from…I recently purchased Lola tampons from Walmart and was very unsatisfied how they are manufactured. On the first day using them the string ripped when I was trying to take it out. I didn’t see it as a big deal at first until I wasn’t able to take it out because of my nails. I had to rush to a small clinic and never felt so humiliated. I was given a pad when I left the clinic. Later that evening I forgot to purchase different tampons so I just put on another Lola. When I removed that one everything was fine and I was thinking I probably had tug the other one too hard. On day 4 of my cycle another Lola tampon string broke again! This time I was so lucky the tampon was in a position where I can take it out. I’m so disappointed with this product and was excited to switch to an organic feminine product line but after these two events I will no longer purchase Lola.Date of experience: October 16, 2020",1,Pharma

Jessica,US,"Apr 13, 2023","Overpriced on their own websiteI discovered Lola after my tampon of choice was discountined a few years ago. I was excited about Lola due to them being organic as well as the compact size. I have overall had good experiences with the compact plastic applicator tampons but after reading other reviews I realize that I have also leaked within an hour of using a super + which is unheard of for me as I generally have a light flow. I do now wonder if there are truly absorbancy issues there. My biggest issue is that they are much more expensive on Lola's own website than they are if you buy them at a retailer so I will now always buy elsewhere. I also purchased a pack of pregnancy tests during the fall last year which I was hoping to keep on hand if they were needed (no one wants to run to the store during a 911 pregnancy scare) and found that the tests expire just 6 months later. Who would use 4 tests in that amount of time? Another brand I purchased prior to getting Lola's tests don't expire for 3 years since purchase.

Sometimes the cotton part doesn't come out when I fully press the applicator.  About 5-10 percent of the time, I take the applicator out and the tampon comes with it.  I've been using tampons my whole life and I'm almost 40, this is not user error...and I'm not doing anything differently when the tampon does come out.  The second problem is: If my flow isn't heavy and the tampon is not saturated and still a little dry in some areas (fyi, I always use appropriate absorbency but it's not always completely predictable, and sometimes flow can be intermittent), then the cotton rips and small pieces of cotton stay inside of me.  I figure this is not healthy at all and could possibly lead to infection, so I have to get the pieces out, and it's just not something I want to have to do.  Again, I've been using tampons for about 27 years, and I've never had this happen with other tampons.

Sarahmost M,US,"Oct 13, 2020","Hurt me before, so they suckOk, So I started ordering your products about a year or two ago and I was or have been pleased mostly with the fact that they are all natural, and made out of cotton.  But the applicators suck, like big time.  Like I cannot recall the number of times I would be inserting a tampon and the applicator would falil to applicate, and yeah I would end up having to throw out a perfectly new good tampon , bc it was no longer usable.  I have been meaning to tell yall about this issue, bc I really want my money back for those. but wait there's more! In addition to this fact, I have actually gotten hurt badly twice putting in your tampons before. The plastic part that encloses the applicator and tampon would pinch me (yes down there) as I was inserting the tampon in to use.  I wouldn't even know how bad I was hurt bv there is already blood there, but yes one time the pinch or injury was so bad I was bleeding and I panicked bc it hurt so much and a fold of skin was caught in there and I was literally stuck like that until I figured out what had happened and I had to pull it back out, with my flesh inside between the two pieces of plastic (which also hurt like a mother *** ) and yeah then I saw the new blood.   I actually was in pain for so long after and was so afraid to use a tampon for a really long time after that. Anyway I really wanted to complain about this for awhile.  and I stopped or cancelled my subscription before because of this occurrence.Date of experience: October 13, 2020",2,Pharma

Chy,US,"Jul 1, 2022","just don’t..If I could give no stars I would.I bought an item a year ago and got roped into a subscription I wasn’t aware of, I spent the last year putting the orders off - delaying shipments because I couldn’t figure out how to cancel it since I never created an account. (I just checked out with PayPal fast checkout)  I went out of town and didn’t have service for a week and got the text that they would be charging my card yesterday, I got home this morning and saw the text and the charge once I got service back and emailed as soon as I noticed (8am) because the order wasn’t placed until last night at 11:14pm so I figured I could get it canceled and refunded.They took 7 hours to respond and only did once I called and left a voicemail, saying that there is nothing they can do once the order is placed (even when it hadn’t shipped yet) she then told me to DONATE OR GIFT THEM since I didn’t want them.I asked about returns, but wouldn’t you know it they also don’t accept those either even if the package is completely unopened and is refused. This is the biggest scam and an awful way to treat people, I gave more than enough time to stop the order process and it’s the Friday of a holiday weekend & Monday is the holiday so I know they’re not shipping it until Tuesday. They’re taking advantage of the fact that they sell intimate products and people can’t return them by also not allowing cancelations so if you forget to pause or like me can’t figure out how to access the “account” to cancel your subscription : don’t buy here!!

Pamela Davis,US,"Aug 29, 2022","Poor Business Practices/ProductsI decided to try Lola tampons and pads since they are organic and can be delivered straight to me. God this has been nothing but a headache since day one. So first when I created my account, I got the verification email and verified the account. Then suddenly it wouldn’t let me sign back in. I tried resetting my password and that wouldn’t work so I created another account using a different email address. I placed an order for their pads and subscribed to their “Lola+” subscription. I never once received a shipping confirmation, and the account I was signed in under didn’t show an active subscription or any pending orders.  Upon reaching out to their customer service team (which you can only do my email btw. And you have to submit your info and wait on THEM to contact you) I was met with no response from them. I finally took it upon myself to google their email and email them DIRECTLY and I was informed that the order was placed under the first account I created (which I find odd seeing as how I couldn’t even get signed back into it) and that the “package had already shipped”. The label wasn’t even created until the following Monday, and I reached out to customer service twice before that without hearing back from them. I had to email them myself (after sending in two contact requests already) and I still didn’t hear anything back until the following day. I had also decided to try their tampons (which are sold at Walmart for almost $3 cheaper than if you order them off the Lola website) only to find them COMING APART INSIDE OF ME. What kind of tampon doesn’t use some kind of protective lining or barrier to prevent chunks of cotton from being left behind?? After these issues I requested a refund for the pads I ordered (I refuse to use a product from a company that is knowingly selling their products even though they are not safe and have had MULTIPLE customers tell them so) and a refund for the subscription that I will not be using (because who in their right mind wants to support a company that’s so shady with their products AND prices). They are refusing to refund me my money for the pads I ordered (I even offered to return the entire package unopened still sealed with their factory’s tape) and refusing to refund my money for their subscription. I’m sorry, but if I were you, I would stay far far away from Lola products. Not only are their tampons dangerous, but they’re ripping you off if you use their subscription service.

I haven’t used other products but I appreciate that the company has forayed into all sorts of menstrual care products that address all the miserable aspects of our cycles. I enjoy the convenience of the delivery and flatly telling my husband when he asks what’s my “package du jour” that it’s tampons, haha. However, this isn’t the first time I’ve said this - the design of the tampons themselves can be problematic. Every period, I have no less than 3 tampons not “eject” properly/fully leaving me with no way to insert them properly and having to discard them unused. This is frustrating because Lola tampons are not cheap, I can’t afford to not be able to use what I pay for and if I’m out at a public restroom when this happens, this can go from frustrating to “uh-oh, now what do I do?” in a hurry. Thanks to companies like Lola revolutionizing the industry, there are a lot more organic tampons to choose from now even at Target. For the cost of Lola products, I just wish they were more reliably functional because If I’m being honest, I’ve definitely test-driven other options that have not shown to have this problem. I mean this last period, I went through 3 malfunctioning Lola tampons (and a lot of swearing) in one (toilet) sitting. I can’t be the only person having this problem.

The only portion that is stated organic is the actual cotton tampon. The applicator is plastic and the wrapper is plastic. The applicator also goes in your body. Which is only momentary but I also care about the waste. Seventh gen tampons have a plant based applicator that is as smooth and comfortable as plastic and has a paper wrapper.

And for like $3, what could possibly go wrong?! A LOT. Luckily, I didn't have the ""disolving"" issues like some of these reviews, but I did have the insertion issues. I'm a plus-size lady who doesn't use tampons all that often, but when I do... I'd damn sure expect them to work properly!! My first attempt was yesterday. As soon as I opened the wrapper & took it out to extend it, it came apart in my hands. So... I had to put my tampon back together. First try at insertion was a literal joke. IT WOULD NOT GO IN. Second try at insertion, and hey, what do you know?! It fell apart. AGAIN! Third try, and it went in. Finally, I thought, success! Until I went to push. I thought I was gonna be hands deep in my lady parts, fishing the whole thing out. The applicator would not push the tampon in. No matter what I did, how hard or soft I pushed on it, what angle I tried. Nothing. Lucky for me, I still had a couple of my Tampax Pocket Radiant tampons left and used those (and I was smart to buy a big box of pads when I bought these s**t Lola tampons!!)

Unfortunately, the flood gates to hell opened up two days prior. I found these organic pads and I was super excited to try them.I bought this new, beautiful pant suit/jumpsuit thingie (I dressed way out of my comfort zone and was nervous enough already). So, I am in our hotel room, with an hour to go till our reservation. Sitting on the toilet, I insert the tampon but the inner-tube wouldn't push in. After struggling for a bit, my vagina decided she had enough of that and dislodged the tampon. I grab #2; insert it, same issue. Using my right hand to hold the tampon still, I use my left hand to try to push the inner-tube in. After fighting it for a while, it SLOWLY pushes the tampon up. I pull the inner-tube and it won't come down.... It won't release the tampon. While, blindly pulling away, I ended up giving myself an ""interesting haircut"". After getting hot and shaking from frustration, I lean against to toilet to relax and breath for a moment. I try to pull it again, same bull crap. My hands are a bloody fricking mess at this point. I yank it out, wrap it up and throw it as vigorously as I can, into the trash. Tampon number 3 on the way.... Everything goes smoothly. The inner-tube pushes up and actually pulls back out. I was so happy!!! Until... It didn't release the tampon AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Everything came out!  After 3, I gave up. Luckily I had some night-time pads I could substitute with.

I visited their website to leave a review multiple times and their Facebook page and it still wouldn't let me leave a review which I feel is sketch.

Katy Erickson,US,"Jun 17, 2020","I really wanted to love Lola Tampons…I really wanted to love Lola Tampons because they are 100% cotton, better for my body, etc., so I tried them for a second time thinking I just got the wrong size tampon. Both cycles using their tampons I leaked about 30-40 minutes after putting a new tampon in. When I removed it, the tampon had barely absorbed anything and did not expand like other brands. Additionally, I wouldn’t recommend doing any light or rigorous exercise while wearing their tampons unless you want major leakage.  If they were to improve their tampons by making them more absorbent, expand while inside, or maybe ones for exercising, I would consider using Lola brand again.Date of experience: June 17, 2020",2,Pharma

The string feels like it’s going to rip when you pull it out because it is very thin and leaks very easily. Most tampons are supposed expand but these do not and I have to change them every 2-4 hours when I normally don’t change my other brand until 6-8 hours. They’re comfortable but I don’t like the feeling that I’m bleeding through it. The applicator is the worst, it’s very uncomfortable to put it in and the cotton will stick to it sometimes making me believe it sheds as well.Date of experience: May 27, 2020",1,Pharma

I don’t have a subscription, actually I never heard of them til I saw their promotion at Walmart. Was wanting to try organic natural cotton feminine  products and it was a decent price, so I got some liners, tampons, and a sample of pads. Really happy I did. They don’t sting or bother me, and although not super observant etc like U by Kotex, still leak free. I’m sensitive in my vagina too, have to use natural dye-free balancing vaginal wash just to do normal outside cleanings in the shower of my vagina, and I noticed I’d feel yeast infections coming on a lot when getting off my periods or a burning like feeling with normal tampons or pads. Not these. I think I’m sensitive to some of the dyes in normal ones, because with these I had no feelings of stinging or burning. So glad I switched and will keep buying organic cotton from here on. A great plus is they’re biodegradable too, so I don’t feel guilty about filling up the land fields either. Love these!Date of experience: May 27, 2020",5,Pharma

Ben Noll,GB,41 minutes ago,"Sadly failed to deliver. Sadly, after providing only one of the two retainers I have had to give up and request a charge back as customer service have ghosted me. Originally I had made the order and got the impression kit almost instantly. However after being given the go ahead to send them back. I was informed of a problem with the impressions. So I had to pay to get another kit. Slightly bothered as we threw away a ""spare"" impression which we could have used if this was raised at the time the original email was sent. Then once this had been sent back, I received only the one of the pair. The ""newest"" impression. After the previous one had been put on hold to wait. Customer service then told me I would need another impression kit and after a few attempts at giving me a code. I had a kit ordered. Since returning this impression set I have not heard from them. upon chasing it up they claim that it was sent back with the ""original"".

The price is pretty fair considering what an orthodontist would charge (at least half the price for these) and the product that arrived was surprisingly better quality than I had imagined.  I was previously a ""Smile Direct"" customer until they went bankrupt, and these retainer are considerably more better quality in terms of material, sturdiness and I believe what will translate into longevity.  The only star missing is they took a LOOOONG time to arrive.  After MANY weeks I gave them an email nudge and they arrive 3 days later.  Not sure what was going on there.  But overall, I would for sure recommend these to someone else.Date of experience: January 04, 2024",4,Pharma

I then wasted the other three pairs of putty trying to get the upper impressions right. Each time I got an identical, canned, vague response indicating there were 'distortions' on the 'front area' of my impression with instructions to watch the videos (which we had already done. Religiously).Now we're left with (a) paying $15 to get two more sets of putty with no guarantee that those will turn out any different or (b) sending in the best-looking impression we've tried and hoping that they work in spite of the email feedback.Their refund policy doesn't apply once you mix even one of the sets of putty, so you're really locked in.In summary, customers need to know that they are paying less money not because they're getting some sort of deal, but because the their business model depends on a certain percentage of people's impressions to not work out and for them to give up and not send impressions in. And if you give them your money you run the risk this will happen to you.Date of experience: July 24, 2024",1,Pharma

The first process of making the mold and sending it in and expecting ten business days to receive them. It took 2 months with multiple emails questioning where my process was at, every week they told me delays and should expect it in a weeks time. I got to the point I wanted to cancel completely, but was reassured that would be sent asap. By the time I received the retainers, only one mold would fit, and it was difficult to remove; felt like my teeth were going to be ripped out if I forced them off quickly. The bottom set was missing a tooth and never fit. I emailed saying I wanted to use the larger mold to make larger impression, was emailed back saying to take pictures of the impressions. Clearly I need them to agree with my request on new impressions with larger mouth piece. I didn't want to deal with the run around and gave up at that point.

Every week I emailed asking for the status, and every week I get an automated reply claiming that my order is in the final stages of production and would be shipped out in a few days. I have email after email, going back weeks, stating the exact same thing from their automated customer service. I finally received the retainer and along with a note saying that the mold lacked detail and had distortions. For eight weeks I waited and not a single person contacted me to tell me this. Instead of contacting me directly and being honest about the timeline and the problem, they made random alterations. The retainer does not fit my teeth and causes severe pain. When I asked for my money back, they asked for photos, without giving me a solution nor a timeline of how long a replacement will take. I have no confidence in this company and their lack of care for their customers. A replacement would likely take weeks and weeks if not months like the original retainer order.

Zoë Hardman,GB,"Nov 13, 2023","Poor comms, poor productThere are several aspects that have made this a disappointing experience. The information on the website on how to take the impressions is contradictory to the instructions in the box in terms of when and how to send the impressions back to them. I also had to pay extra for postage, despite being in the free-return window because the box was slightly bigger once the impressions were in it.The end result is poor quality. The retainers barely cover the teeth, so they’re unlikely to offer the support needed. When I complained about these things, the communication has been dismal. I’ve had to chase several times, ultimately taking weeks to get any sort of “final answer”. That final answer basically being ‘deal with it’.I get the feeling this is a small business being run on the side of a busy dental practice, which is no bad thing but clearly they don’t have the time or resource to manage both businesses and should focus on one.

We completed the impressions following the instructions and sent photos of the impressions to get them approved before sending them back. We received approval of the impressions and sent them in to have the retainers made. The time it took to get the “retainers” back was a bit ridiculous, and to my surprise when we opened the package there was a post card that was filled out with boxes checked that said things like “your upper impression was shallow did not capture all the teeth or the gumline” and “your upper impression had some distortion and lacked detail” The same comments were made for the lower impressions. Then there was a handwritten part of the postcard that said “Lower last molars not included.” Are you kidding me? Why on earth would you have made the retainers if the impressions were not good enough and didn't even include ALL OF THE TEETH?? Why would you have “approved” these impressions? This is absolutely mindboggling to me that you would deliver a subpar product and include a note basically saying “the impressions were no good, so here’s some crappy retainers”?

Michael Brown,US,"Jul 11, 2024","retainers made with inferior materialsI ordered my retainers after taking the molds of my teeth and it took a long time with very little communication about the timing.  I had to badger the company several times as it was more than double the estimated time to make the retainers.  Then, inside of 30 days, the top retainer cracked.  They replaced it at no cost which was fine.  I was hoping that was a one off as in the past when I had retainers they did not crack.  These seem to be of thinner material.  I had purchased the multi-year replacement program and figured this would be good.  Recently, now about 3-4 months later the bottom retainer cracked.  They said it was possibly because i may clench or grind my teeth which may be true - I am not sure, but these should be thick enough to withstand what is normal activity.  When I asked about the cracked bottom retainer, they asked for photos which they had one as well on the first round.  I sent them and they offered to replace it with a $49 charge.  Frankly, I thought that was my discounted price anyhow under the 3-year program which I paid extra for.  Now, they also want me to send back my molds to make the new retainers.  This does not make sense as I did not have to do this when they replaced by cracked upper retainer.  This process is complicated and I am not very pleased.  I think they should be able to send these more quickly and with less hassle and not crack so easily.  They should last with normal use for at the very least - one full year.  I am only part of their program as SmileDirect went under so this is overall a disappointing experience.

Received an email back stating that they apologized for the delay, and that my retainers should be sent out that week. Frustrating, but fine at least I'd be getting them soon.It is now 12/13. I have received no further updates. I still do not have my retainers. At this point I'm wondering if I'll be getting them at all. Do not tell your customers the turnaround is 7-10 days when it has now been well over a month without receiving them. I'm not usually one to complain about companies, but when it comes to retainers customers need them quickly to avoid further shifting of teeth. Thankfully my existing pair are still holding up. If I don't wear them for 2 nights in a row my teeth already begin shifting. Frankly this is just unacceptable from Retainers Direct.Not to mention, they are misrepresenting their Trust Pilot rating on their website as being 5 stars. That's clearly not the case, so on top of having poor service, they are just flat out lying to you. Look elsewhere for retainers.Date of experience: December 12, 2023",1,Pharma

Miry Russell,US,"Updated Dec 7, 2024","Difficult Process, Received Refund3rd Update- They have issued me a refund which I appreciate and feel is a fair response to the ill-fitting retainer. I will be seeing an orthodontist to get a replacement retainer. 2nd Update- They changed their minds and will not be giving me a refund because it's been 60 days from the date of purchase. That is a terrible policy given that how long the process takes is not solely dependent on you as the customer.Update- I have been offered a refund for the lower retainer which I appreciate and feel is an appropriate response. I have chosen to update my review from 2 stars to 4. Upper Impression and Retainer  I chose Retainers Direct as a more affordable alternative to purchasing retainers from an orthodontist. Their videos and instructions for creating dental impressions at home with putty and a tray appeared simple enough.  Initially, I had issues with my upper impression. After submitting pictures via email for review, my upper impression was rejected. I had to purchase $15 putty and return labels multiple times to retry the process. On the positive side, their customer service representative was friendly and helpful, and they provided video support to guide me through the process.  Once my upper impression was finally approved, I sent it in, and they successfully created my upper retainer.  Lower Impression and Retainer  My lower impression was initially approved through email, but after I mailed it in, they claimed it was distorted and needed to be redone. This was frustrating, as the approval had already been given. I understand that evaluating impressions via email can be challenging, but I believe the company should assume responsibility for their approval process. If more pictures were required for an accurate evaluation, they should have requested them upfront rather than rejecting the impression post-shipment.  To resolve the issue, I had to purchase more $15 putty and return labels, which I felt the company should have covered since the mistake stemmed from their approval process. After several attempts and video call support, my final impression was deemed acceptable via video call. I emailed pictures, didn’t receive a reply, and sent it in. Unfortunately, the lower retainer they made does not fit.  I reached out to them several days ago about the ill-fitting retainer but have not received a response. While they did send me a case and retainer cleaning solution as a goodwill gesture, it does not address the unresolved issue.  Overall Impression and Recommendations  The customer service team at Retainers Direct is friendly and willing to help, but the process of creating accurate dental impressions from home seems fraught with challenges. While I appreciate their support, I believe the company needs to take responsibility for approving impressions via email. If an impression is later deemed unacceptable, they should cover the cost of additional materials and shipping.  Additionally, if a retainer is made from an approved impression and doesn’t fit, a refund or replacement should be provided. This is essential to maintain trust and satisfaction with their service.  I rarely leave negative reviews, but I hope this feedback is seen as constructive criticism. With a few process improvements, Retainers Direct could become an excellent option for affordable retainers.Date of experience: November 25, 2024",4,Pharma

JH,US,"Updated Sep 13, 2023","Lost my impressions, poor quality, etcMy impressions fell out while they were being shipped back to Retainers Direct; the seal must've broken on the Retainers Direct-provided envelope or something must've happened with USPS as I took care to make sure it was sealed before sending it off. It took a while for them to get back to me telling me the impressions fell out in transit, and I was relying on those retainers so now my teeth shifted far enough where I need treatment again. I accepted their offer for a refund on the retainers, but now they’re trying to subtract $20 from my refund to cover shipping and impression costs (as part of their 30-day return policy, but this wasn't applicable as it's not like I changed my mind or anything like that). They were the ones taking care of shipping and obviously shipping failed, so why is the customer paying for it?

Chad,US,"Jul 17, 2024","Unfortunately I don’t have anything…Unfortunately I don’t have anything good to say about Retainers Direct. I was one of the people that used SmileDirect…and I was used to poor customer service (but always a good product). Before I purchased from Retainers Direct I called and spoke with them. They told me how they are a small mom and pop operation and offer the BEST customer service, and a superior product to other retainer companies. They reassured me that I will be very pleased and they always make sure their customers are happy. Unfortunately, that was the last positive experience I had with Retainers Direct. I ordered my retainers and it took 4x longer to receive than what they quoted to me. I called and emailed and several times and all but 1 of messages were ignored. When I finally did get somebody on the phone and I explained that I have been waiting close to 2 months for my retainers, her response to me was “we are very busy. We have many orders. There’s nothing else I can tell you. You’ll get your retainers as soon as they are ready.” Fast forward - I did get my retainers without having any communication from the company at all. No apologies about it taking so long. No discount code for future orders since the order did take so long and I received such poor service. No tracking # once they did ship. Nothing! Now, the icing on the cake…my brand new retainers cracked after having them 1.5 months. I contacted Retainers Direct to let them know and they told me “we offer a 30 day return policy. Sorry about that, but the only thing I can help you with is ordering a new pair.” I NEVER had retainers crack before with any other company, and I would use them 6 months to a year at a time.  My suggestion for anybody reading this is DON’T purchase your retainers from Retainers Direct. There are other companies - purchase from somebody else. I only wish that I had read a review like the one I’m writing before I ever purchased from Retainers Direct. I hope I’m saving some potential customers from purchasing from this sham of a company. They offer the WORST level of customer service and a terrible product that will not hold up! I cannot begin to tell you how frustrated and angry I am with my experience.

Jacob Solomon,US,"Updated Sep 21, 2023","Nightmare process and poor customer serviceI got my lower impression right off the bat but struggled with my upper. I ordered multiple sets of putty (and the company included a free 3rd set each time which I really appreciated) but still could not get a good impression of my upper. I was getting frustrated.Finally, on my own accord, I went to a local orthodontist where I was lucky enough to receive a ton of help from their impression specialist. We used my last two sets of putty and still couldn't get a good impression. She even commented that their putty is just not up to the job. She used HER OWN putty mix and got me a great impression. Without her I would have been screwed... Got my lower and upper impression to Retainers Direct and before I knew it I had a tracking number. Yay finally almost done! Nope not at all. They sent my retainers to Florida (I live here in Abq, NM so the shipping should've been easy since I'm local). I got ahold of Tanner at Retainers Direct and explained to him the situation. He apologized and said they'd re-ship my retainers with 1 day shipping. 2 days pass and still nothing... so I call back and get ahold of Richard, their retainer specialist. He says he will let Tanner know to call me back. Of course Tanner never calls me back so I call back 2 days later and again Richard picks up. He goes ahead and looks into my retainers for me and says that they were never even shipped... Tanner told me 1 day shipping and never sent them lol what a joke.Richard, an absolute saint, says he will create a new set of retainers for me THAT DAY and will drop them off at the orthodontist where I received help at. I stopped by there the next day to pick them up and finally this grueling process was over.All in all I would've paid more money to get something like this done in person. This company makes creating impressions sound easy and convenient and when it's not, they're barely there to help you.Shout out to Lisa at the orthodontist and Richard.

ash,US,"Jan 6, 2024","DO NOT USE THIS COMPANYPlease don’t use this company! I cannot speak on quality of the retainer itself because well we’ve still never received them! We received the impression kit quickly but don’t assume they prioritize the turnaround time. And if you think for one minute you’re gonna contact customer service; think again because they answer their phones apparently like once a month. It took me 3 weeks to get someone to answer at the number they provide. Furthermore, It’s nothing like you’d expect when calling a business. There’s no recording with options it just rings and rings like you’re calling a house and then a voicemail picks up and it says nothing more than “Thanks for calling. Leave a message after the beep.” There’s absolutely no identifiable information on the recording to even let you know it’s actually a “business”. Just for some background information we received our impression kit on November 20th and mailed it back on November 21st. Also, there’s no way to look online if or when they received it, what the status is, or any kind of information for your order other than your original order for the impressions. I received an email on December 7 stating “We received your impressions and are currently in the process of crafting your custom retainers. Our typical turnaround time is around 7-10 days. We're currently on track and expect to complete your retainers within this timeframe.” I started trying to contact someone regarding the actual status of our order the on December 11 because I’m certain it didn’t take 16 days for them to receive the impressions. I left message after message on the “voicemail”, sent numerous emails and just FINALLY had someone answer the phone on January 2nd! The gentleman looked up my order and told me the retainers were done and shipping that day and I would receive tracking information that day via email. Well guess what….it’s January 5th and I’ve never received an email nor been able to get ahold of anyone at that number again. I honestly don’t understand how they haven’t been shut down! So here I am almost 7 weeks later and my daughters teeth have began to shift because I thought I was gonna save 700 by using them vs going through her actual orthodontist. We now have an appointment with her orthodontist and I’m uncertain what the outcome will be but I am certain that I didn’t save any money. While I can’t blame them for my daughter losing her retainers I do blame them for promising a service and not providing it in a timely manner or well at all for us at this point. Do yourself a favor, if you’re replacing retainers that are preventing teeth from shifting, go to the orthodontist, use another business, DO NOT utilize this company!Date of experience: January 05, 2024",1,Pharma

Avo Babikian,US,"Aug 9, 2023","AVOID THIS SERVICEI purchased a set of retainers back in March of 2023. The initial box came with a couple sets of putty and my girlfriend and I attempted to create the mold. Upon a couple attempts, we weren't able to create a proper mold to send back to them. I sent them an email and they stated that we need to buy additional sets of 'putty' which are ($15/ea). We bought additionally sets, and upon mixing the 'putty', it got hard instantly and we weren't even able to attempt to create the mold the second time, this caused months of delay due to shipping, etc..Finally, I decided that I no longer wanted to move forward with them creating my retainers as their system clearly isn't working. I emailed to receive a refund for the amount i paid for the retainers and they denied my request for a refund since the initial order was placed in March. Basically, they aren't giving me a refund for an item that I did not even receive.This company is an outright scam model, in which they give you putty that does not work, which forces you to buy additional putty and causes their refund policy time period to pass and you will be left with no retainers and -$250 in your bank account.Avoid them at all costs.Date of experience: March 15, 2023",1,Pharma

R. S.,US,"Updated Jul 27, 2023","Tricky Money-Back Policy—Watch OutEverything this company does is designed to ensure that you cannot easily take advantage of their refund policy, even if the retainers they send you are faulty and painful to put on. Despite taking perfect impressions, sending photos of them in advance, and receiving written confirmation from the company that they were good, I received a note with my retainers that said that they had been modified because of distortions. Clearly, the impressions were damaged during shipment (in which case shipping insurance should have picked up the costs), or they were improperly handled during the tray removal process or beyond. The retainers I received were extremely painful to put on. I've been wearing retainers for over five years now; I know the difference between tight retainers and distorted ones. Wearing these ones would have caused long-term changes in the positioning of my teeth.Here are some tricky things about the company that I wish I knew about before I placed my order:1. Customer service is very prompt and friendly before you place an order, but somewhat sporadic, rude, and cursory after you receive your retainers. After ordering, the emails I received from Darren Haltom were either generic form emails or one-liners that avoided directly answering the questions I had about what might have gone wrong in the production process.2. The company does not take responsibility for faulty retainers and will not refund you for production errors.3. You can only use their money-back guarantee within 30 days of placing your initial order, not 30 days of receiving your retainers. Given that you have to receive the impression kit, take impressions, get them approved, send them back, wait for the retainers to be made (8 business days), and finally receive them in the mail, this effectively means that you have about 24 hours to try on the retainers and decide whether or not you need a refund. If you reach out to customer service with an issue, they will stall you with advice, perhaps to try to get you past that 30-day time limit. When I politely explained my issue to Darren, for example, he asked me to send him photos of me wearing the retainers, then waited a couple of days, then insisted they were fine, then asked me whether my teeth had shifted, and finally told me to run the retainers under warm water. This last piece of advice probably takes the prize for ""questionable thing you should probably not do."" If you soften distorted retainers to try to get them on, they cool back down into their original shape and start repositioning your teeth according to their own distortions. Note that each of these emails with Darren takes time. I responded within minutes or hours to each of them, but he would wait a day or a whole weekend between messages, eventually pushing us past the 30-day refund policy. After that, he was like ""gotcha, you lose!"": ""Your order was placed on June 21. The policy states that no shipping costs will be refunded.""4. If you are ordering only retainers and use the 15% off coupon code, you save just $2.50 because you no longer qualify for free shipping, which costs $20. This may seem fine, but if you opt for a refund, you forfeit all $20 of the original shipping fee. If you are absolutely determined to order from this company, you may be better off not using the promotional code and opting for free shipping instead.Date of experience: July 23, 2023",1,Pharma

The trays sent are too small. My teeth barely fit in, scraping it against the side of the tray. If I attempt to force my teeth in then the tray sits uncomfortably against my gums. I don't know why RD tray sizing is so limited when the company doesn't have the same overhead as in-person dental services and is catering to many people whom they can't access in-person, but I want my money back.Date of experience: July 10, 2023",1,Pharma

I emailed customer service and they said the’re is only a 30 day fit guarantee.  My old retainer made by orthodontist has lasted over 10 years and is visibly thicker heavier duty plastic.

I had my dentist's office help me with making the first impressions... however I think they got smushed in the bubble mailer during shipping to the lab. My first aligner arrived ill-fitting and even looked obviously squished (the central incisors were much shorter than my actual teeth are). Upon messaging the company, they instructed me to take another impression and they would remake it right away. This time I took the impressions myself and sent it in a *box* to the lab, to ensure the impression wouldn't get squished in transit. The lab turned it around within a week and I had a PERFECTLY fitting retainer! So while there was a hiccup with the first try, they definitely did a great job with the second one.

They were quick to respond to emails and would says yes to everything, but at the end didn’t do any of the things they promised and just brushed me off and not even an apology. After paying over $400 for two retainer kits I asked Darren if he could send all the retainers in one larger package instead of two separate packages to ensure it gets delivered to the door as I’m staying at an Airbnb with no access to the mailbox. He said no problem.Later on I told him it might be safer to just deliver to General delivery address so I can pick up at the post office. He said no problem. When I got the delivery notification email I noticed that the address is still the original Airbnb address.  I asked Darren to confirm if the address was changed and his response was he was unable to send a product to general delivery. I questioned why he said no problem in the first place and it would have been nice to let me know before he shipped it. He didn’t give any explanation or apologize and simply said thanks for your understanding. I managed to intercept the package from the postman and not only did they not send it in a large package as they said they would, they only sent one set of the retainers and not both sets I ordered.I emailed Darren again, and rather than checking himself what I ordered and what they shipped out he had to ask me multiple times to confirm my order details and what I received, even though I already said it in my email. When I got the delivery notification for the missing retainers I noticed that it was sent using first class and not priority mail that I paid extra for. I wrote to him to complain about the multiple issues. He did quickly change the delivery to priority mail but never replied to my email . This just shows how much they care about customer satisfaction. Even if I didn’t pay for priority mail you would think they would still try to send out the missing retainers as quick as possible instead of trying to use the cheapest shipping method.

Initially, I was approached with samples, but the situation quickly escalated into a high-pressure sales tactic involving rude and manipulative behavior from their staff. They applied products without my consent and insisted on selling items at varying prices with damaged packaging.The worst part was when my card was taken from my hands without permission, and they processed a $53.50 transaction without properly informing me or showing a return policy. Soon after, I experienced an allergic reaction to the sample applied on my wrist, leading me to return the product within 30 minutes. However, the staff were dismissive, rude, and refused a refund, instead insisting on an exchange despite my clear discomfort and dissatisfaction.I left the product at the kiosk, but this entire ordeal was distressing and unethical. Upon researching, I found numerous complaints and allegations against this company online, which align closely with my experience. Avoid this company at all costs—deceptive practices like this should not be tolerated.They claim no responsibility for the franchise's policy or behavior; totally wrong; if they rent their brand they should be responsible if they rented their brand to criminals.Date of experience: October 25, 2024",1,Pharma

This was after we were told by another vendor who sold hair products(whom we bought something from) that we would receive something free. He lied. So sitting there forever after the eye cream she said she wouldn't leave us hanging either one eye undone. She never did the other eye after telling her I didn't want to spend another 300 on products. I don't get why when you tell someone you're broke from shopping a d continue to push and say ""well its a good deal and willsave in the future"" It's so uncomfortable and awkward when pushed.

Con artists, I wonder what kind of training do they receive lol they always treat you like “the most important customer” when you get in the store, they brainwash you, test the products in you, offer discounts, offer a facial cleansing or some other crap, pretend to be your friend until you buy. Once they made their commission they don’t give a f* about you. The products, terrible... caused me rashes, dryness among other uncomfortable and visible things on my skin. I took their products to a professional dermatologist, a real doctor, a real professional not a salesresp bullshitter like the ones they have in the stores, and she told me those ingredients are made for you to use them, damage your skin and then get some a lot more expensive for them so it can repair the damage.

Somehow the price got pushed from $250 to $99, which made me very skeptical. But I was in a hurry, and decided to spend the $99 on the body scrub and butter. Though I wasn't the biggest fan of the sales tactic, I absolutely love the product. I have a multitude of skin issues, and the scrub and butter surprisingly didn't irritate my skin; it helped it!

The salesperson did a demo of the wrinkle cream and yes the bags under my eyes disappeared within minutes. I thought this is amazing so after some haggling about the price I bought it. I was scammed. There is a beige tint to this product and the way the salesperson held the mirror it looked like the bags under my eyes were gone.  All an optical allusion.  I have been using this for 2 months now and nothing has changed at all.  I still have bags under my eyes. Another thing you can't wear this as a concealer because when it dries it cracks and is very noticeable so you can only use it at night while you are sleeping and it DOES NOT gradually tighten the skin under your eyes so the bags are gone.

I asked about the life time warranty & was told I'd have to contact the product company online Apology...which I did. I am told that in order to receive a replacement of the very expensive wand I would first have to jump through several burning fire hoops. 1st) must have all original packaging, container box the wand came in 2nd) must have sales receipt showing when, where & how much you spent & acquired your product.  3rd) you must make a video showing the product explaining what happened to it & what you feel is the cause for its failure to continue working. REALLY! 🙄  I'm not an expert on their products & equipment, but I bought all in good faith. I am not a bully & I don't like being bullied by companies who get you to buy their products & then use the fine print to get out of holding up their end of the bargain  I enjoyed the products I have no complaints about their effectiveness I'm just very ""disappointed"" in the service end. 🩶Date of experience: April 04, 2024",4,Pharma
Molly,US,"Dec 25, 2020","Horrible experience in the Hanes mall…Horrible experience in the Hanes mall in Winston Salem NC. I was pressured by a very talkative salesman and pushed to buy a product I can not really afford. I told him when I sat down I wasn’t going to buy anything but he just kept talking. He initially tried to sell me the peel for 309$. I said no.He tried again for 120$. I said no.He said 80$ and I went for it. Instantly regretted it. After reading the product reviews and considering the cost I decided it was not for me. I tried to return the item 4 days later completely unopened, plastic wrap still in place. They would not let me return the item, but they did however usher me into the back of the store as I was very upset and they did not want me to ruin future sales w other people. I left in tears as I am now stuck with a sub par product that I do not want. Do not buy these products or trust these shady sales people.Date of experience: December 25, 2020",1,Pharma

He lured me in and tried the Hermetise product on me. I saw a difference and felt my skin visibly tighten.  He also told me he was giving me the product 1/2 off at $399 with something free and then he sold me another cream for 1/2 off at $250.  I came out of there almost $700 less, but thought it would be worth it because he said it lasted a year and I could already see a difference after the first application.  He also scheduled me for a facial and red light wand therapy for free.  However, the guy tried to sell me a $10,000 red light wand. I said ""no, thank you."" to that.  When I arrived home, I applied the cream thinking I would feel my skin tighten and see results like I did the week before.  I did not notice any change at all. There wasn't a tightening to my skin and my lines were all there.  I feel completely scammed.  I would not have purchased the cream if there had not been a difference.

Donna Munro,CA,"Updated Sep 9, 2023","SCAM SCAM SCAMWe purchased the wrinkle eraser and exfoliant after a demo at the CNE in Toronto. The cream the guy used on our faces immediately lifted deep wrinkles and totally erased the bags from under my husbands eyes. We paid $200 each for the wrinkle cream and $75 for the exfoliant and when we got home and used the product it was nothing like the product they used on us in the demo and did absolutely nothing. In the demo the product balled up giving the appearance it was taking off your extra dead skin but I discovered it's the "" actual product "" that balls up and it did the same thing when I applied it to a piece of paper. What a rip off this company is and they tried to use high pressure sales tactics on us which didn't work and we purchased of our own free will knowing it was way overpriced but I must say I didn't expect the product itself to be a different product and therefore actual trickery and deceit involved. The lady came over and tried to sell me an $8000 face machine afterwards and when I asked her if she was "" high "" she said I'll give it to you for $4000. I told her she'd met her match and moved on and she said ""don't you want to look good "" ? to which I replied "" Don't I already look good"" ? this company is misrepresenting their products in the worst way and I would steer very clear of them. They all seem to be engaging in very high pressure sales tactics and were not honest and basically scammed us.

Then the next guy comes “because” he’s the expert and he starts trying g to sell me the machine. I was still a “No” and eventually he got really mad and told me I was wasting his time. I said I had no interest in tools without researching from the first mention. After #2 left I looked at myself in the mirror and could still see product on my face so I asked if i could borrow a Kleenex.

The luxurious formula of both products feels indulgent, and the packaging exudes sophistication.The serum's lightweight texture glides on effortlessly, absorbing quickly without any greasy residue. I noticed an immediate hydration boost, and over time, fine lines around my eyes visibly diminished. The powerful blend of ingredients seems to work wonders for firmness and elasticity.Complementing the serum, the eye cream adds an extra layer of nourishment. Its rich consistency feels incredibly moisturizing, leaving the delicate skin around my eyes feeling supple. I appreciate that it targets puffiness and dark circles, giving my eyes a refreshed and well-rested appearance.What sets Hermetise apart is not just the product efficacy but also the attention to detail in packaging and presentation. The sleek design of the bottles enhances the overall experience, making it a treat for both the eyes and the senses.While the price point may be higher compared to some other options on the market, the visible results and the overall luxurious experience make Hermetise Age Delay Eye Serum and Eye Cream a worthwhile investment for those seeking a premium skincare solution.Date of experience: November 20, 2023",5,Pharma

Yesterday I went to La Cantera in San Antonio, Texas and was brought into the store by a woman handing out sample lotions in front of Hermitage. She called me with the word My Love and I was uncomfortable but I could get access to the products she recommended and tested. She offered me a high price for a product that wasn't very special, so I said I'd read reviews of the brand, look into the ingredients, and come back, so she changed her face to a stiff face and an unfriendly tone and dealt with the price down. Introducing and selling products is their job. And they work in the service sector. The service industry may not always be, but employees should respond to customers with a basic mindset of the service industry, and it is ridiculous that if customers listen to them well, they are kind and if they don't listen to them, they change their faces immediately.Customers have heard the product description but do not buy it, it is the customer's right and free will. And the price down doesn't make sense either. The Peeling product introduced as $299 suddenly becomes $84 and the 141 product becomes $49. It must be a fraud to see that the price more than tripled on the spot means how much the product costs, and that even though the price has fallen, there is a profit left for them. Eventually, I bought a $49 peeling product after a little scuffle, and when I got home, she had paid $50. It was $1 but it was really enough to ruin my mood, and my trust in this company and its products was completely lost, so I threw the products I bought into the trash can. I'd buy a lawyer if it was a little more expensive. In order for a company to succeed, it is the integrity of its products and trust from its customers. There have been many cases of reviewing the same bad experiences as well as me, but I don't understand if companies are sitting on their hands.

Lo and behold, we get to the end and I'm told that I can buy the whole set of products for a whopping $650! As if. I told her to take a hike, but she continued to prod, using every sales tactic under the sun to try and pressure me into buying something; it's a special promotion only for today, I'll throw in another cream for free if you promise not to tell anyone (""can I trust you?"" she said), bringing the price down to an eventual $140 and then asking how I would like to pay, etc etc. It was obvious that she was desperately hunting for a sale. Well luckily I had enough fortitude to stand my ground and say no. And let me tell you, she was visibly angry when it became clear that I wasn't budging. The experience prompted me to hop online to look for reviews and now I learn that so many others have experienced the same thing. However I am absolutely horrified to see the amount of people that actually bought the damn products! Jeez people, you must learn to say no! But there's no denying that their sales tactics are slimey, dangerous, and EFFECTIVE. I can absolutely see how this approach would work on a lot of people. As my titles indicates, it is designed to fleece you and take advantage of your politeness and people-pleasing tendencies. They will pitch to you at an intentionally high pace so that you are never given a single moment to think; always either talking about or demonstrating the product, or asking you personal questions to create the illusion of buddy-buddy friendliness. Be aware, they are experts at taking complete control of the situation so that you can never feel truly grounded and level-headed. Please remember, this is NOT the time to be ""nice"" and buy something you don't need just to make a filthy salesperson happy. This so-called business was conceived by disgusting, verminous parasites to exploit your sensibilities and squeeze as much money out of you as possible. Don't fall for it.Date of experience: April 16, 2023",1,Pharma
Gina Ray,US,"Sep 17, 2022","Downtown Fort Lauderdale 2 weeks ago…Downtown Fort Lauderdale 2 weeks ago and I was talked into coming into the store. It started with Diamond Collagen Moisturizer $300.00 a jar. They talk so fast and offering deals. Two jars for $150.00 I bought them thinking I could get out of there. Then it really began no matter how many times I said no she just continued about how good a deal she could give me don't tell anyone. Over a $1000.00 finally got out of store. I think only because it was after their closing time. As soon as I left the store I felt sick I did not have money to spend like this. Not sure who teaches these people how to scam and lie but they are good at it. I am sure they call it sales technique. Prices are all over the chart on what I have read they sale these items for. Beginning to think they are $20.00 products and whatever they can sell it over is a profit. All I can say if you see these places stores ahead of time go to the other street as fast as you can. Or just be rude and ignore keep on walking. Once you talk to them and they get you in the store they see sucker and won't let you go until they have sold you all they can.Date of experience: September 07, 2022",1,Pharma

Traci Phillips,US,"Sep 21, 2023","STUPID unnecessary tactics for BEST ProductsHey CORPORATE READ ME! How I wished they didn't use the sell tactics that they do. And here is why!! Their products! OMG they work!!!  If I was made of money, fine, when they initially try to push you for the ridiculous price. But then they drop the price over and over like a used car salesman does. Why!!! Just charge the lowest price you give and more will buy. Supply and Demand. Then these reviews about your sales tactics will go away and  be replaced by glowing ones. LITERALLY GLOWING (FROM USING YOUR PRODUCTS!) TRY THEM, REALLY TRY THEM. You will so no need to push such Shaddy tactics. I'm mortified to recommed your products in fear those will be taken advatange of or embrassed by the online reviews. As a former VP of Sales and Marketing in a different industry you are causing reputation damage for what? Those few that buy at your outrageous first offer?! How about this just sell those same few more products? Gain more market share.  That way when they figure you out, they rave about the products instead of filing complaints for the shady tactics. Otherwise slowly over time (I'm sure you're feeling it already) you're amazing products will become obsolete. I think your products are way too good and probably the best ever of what I've used in my time - Image, Obagi, Color Science and very expensive ones like Le Mer and La Prairie. $100 a jar is plenty. You're welcome! Only because it's true and my skin is witness 44yrs of age going on 30. I have 20 somethings coming after me all the time.

Mary Jovic,CH,"Nov 25, 2020","Very strange storeVery strange store, I could not believe something like this could happen to me in Zurich.I was lured by a young man standing at the entrance of the store giving me a handcream sample. I took it and somehow few seconds later I ended up at the chair. He started putting products on my hands, on my face and asking me questions about my age, my job my relationship, products I use. But I had no chance to answer to his question as he answered them himself. He didn't stop talking. I had to go but I had no chance to say that. He spoke so fast and did his treatments, I got so angry but stayed polite.In the end I bought a nailpolish for 99.-Then wanted to leave finally, but he again put me on the chair and started speaking about presents. He wants to give me this and that and even a facial treatment, the only thing I should do is tell my friends how great the products are.Then he took a calculator and entered some figures and saying, it will only cost 16chf per month. And I go, but you said you give me as a present. And he goes, he will give me the peeling and the facial, but I pay 300 for the serum. And then I ask how does he think it's 16 chf per month.He goes because it lasts a year. I said I'm sorry, I will not buy anything. Then he tried again to sell me another product for half price. Then I left. I was in the store for 45mins.Very annoying treatment. Don't go there unless you want to spend few hundreds for products.Date of experience: November 25, 2020",1,Pharma

Alexxi Porter,US,"Jul 7, 2021","Poor product and rude StaffI posted a review which they just removed because it was negative I had stopped in the morning and bought product with Nicole and booked a facial that afternoon, before a ""medical convention"" she had to go too. I was to have brought 4 products.  She circled the products she sold me on the paper with instructions on how to use.As I was walking to the afternoon facial, a man (her manager) at a sister store said Nicole told him, about my facial and he was coming down so she could go to the medical conference.  At the facial, she tried to sell me more products. Nicole was so rude when I told her no. She told me ""but you will spend $200 on a dinner?""  ""You don't have time - that is just an excuse.  Everyone has time""   She was really shaming and blaming me!!  Then, she got her manager in the room.  Neither one would let me out of the room for awhile, either!! Within the hour, my face was red, itchy, and burning with a mild rash.  I immediately went back to the store and she said ""That's good it is red, itchy, and rash, and hot.  That means it is working"".  I reminded her I did not get the facial that warmed and heated, as she offered.  Rather, I got the cooling collagen treatment.  She said she would not return anything.  I left my review and emailed Hermetise.  Hermetise corporate office to Declined to get involved I stopped by the sister stores where Nicole‘s manager worked and they refused to help.  They actually said none of it was their product; they had never seen it before. Curious, Nicole's manager would work there!  That night, after benadryl and treatment for the itchy and rash, I noticed I was given eye removal instead of the eye cream, Nicole circled on the paper and I was missing the 24 hour tightening and brightening cream. The next day, I stopped in the store but Nichole wasn't there and no one would help me. I stopped at another sister store who also refused to help.  they said I had to go back to the original store for an exchange.Date of experience: July 07, 2021",2,Pharma

This is when the scam starts! A very friendly lady says please sit down I want to show you how amazing you can look. She takes this face cream and this electronic device and is rubbing my wife’s face.The results were noticeable.She then mentioned the machine is very expensive, nine thousand. If you want it I can see if my boss can give it to you for a deal.She returns and says he’ll give it to you for 5 thousand.This is a steal you can use it all the time and look young and have your face look firm.Long story short, she gives us another thousand off.So for four thousand you get the machine’s for your face and eyes with about six different creams.When I said I can’t afford it and would like some time to think about this purchase she had three glasses of champagne in us.She told her boss to get us financed fo Four thousand and said “come on treat yourself”.We financed the amount for one year.When I left I knew I made a huge mistake.I went back today(next day) and tried to return it.The boss said to call customer service.I asked him to call for me and he said I can’t and won’t!I got the police involved and after an hour the policed helped me to get a lady from customer service on the phone.She said once they get paid they will get me a return label.Please stay away from anyone who pressures you.They know your relaxed and on vacation and take full advantage!!!Date of experience: August 26, 2022",1,Pharma

Jessi Fisher,US,"Jan 25, 2024","I was first given a free sample of…I was first given a free sample of Hermetise at a resort in Hawaii. I fell in love, but when I went on the website I wasn't prepared for the pricing. However, I believe quality should come at a price so I saved up and nearly a year later purchased my first product directly via the Hermestise website. I placed the order on January 11, 2023. I immediately received an email confirmation for the order saying I would receive shipping info shortly. A couple days went by and nothing. Then five days. Then six. Finally I decided to reach out and see if there was an issue since I found it odd that a week had passed with no additional contact. I used the live chat option to speak with a customer service rep directly on the Hermetise website. The very first thing the rep typed to me was ""what's the order number"" not a hello, my name is, thank you for being a customer, nothing. I gave them the order number and the next thing I received was simply, ""need shipping address."" I was somewhat taken aback with the bluntness, I expected at least a ""thank you for that info, could you also provide me with the shipping address please?"" But I guess they were trying to save time. I provided the address and explained that I had placed an order a week prior and had not heard anything since. The rep told me that they needed to verify the shipping address since it differed from the billing address. I totally understand this and appreciate them wanting to double check, but it had been a week and I had not received one email or phone call asking for verification. My email and phone number was right on the order confirmation, so they had it all. The rep said they had tried to reach me but I double checked both my email and junk mail and phone records but showed no missed calls, no voicemails and no follow-up emails. Once I was able to verify my shipping address with the rep I instantly received an email with shipping confirmation. I am somewhat disappointed with not only the way the rep addressed me in the beginning but also the fact that I paid nearly $400 for a product and no one would have done anything if I hadn't have reached out to find out what the issue was. I would expect much better customer service from a luxury company such as Hermetise. I was a little put off by the experience but thankfully the product is so great I will more than likely order again. I'm just letting you know so this doesn't happen to anyone else in the future.

Then once I was getting to know her I brought up a concern that I had. I had purchased the peeling mask and a suringe filler about 3 or maybe even 4 years ago. I put it in my closet and never used either. I knew that were good products, however I was confused as to how to use them. The guy at the Kiosk in Austin, Texas was smooth in showing me but no instruction sent home on either product. I got brave about a year or so ago and tried the mask. It barely had any in it (from evalopation I guess) and I used what little was in the jar. I used it and I had a couple of folks mention that my skin looked smoother. I got in touch with your customer service to let me know that I didn't use either product but did try the mask and hoping I could get a new bottle of it. No one returned my email. I called and left numerous messages with customer service it was so frustrating. I went ahead and ordered more of the peeling mask. I explaned all of this to Alex. She was son patient and anxious and personable to help me. I feel so much better about using your products now that I know you guys will help me with these products. I am older woman and sometimes instruction on how to works for me. Thanks to Alex she provided me an email and ask me to send a pic of the filler tube.

Unfortunately, that's when two high pressured salesmen started their spiel. First they claimed the moisturizer they were putting on my mom was worth thousands, but they eventually dropped the price to $300. Then they began using a wand to help wrinkles, that they claimed was also worth thousands. My mom did see a temporary difference in her eye puffiness, so she thought the cream was real. She did ask if she wasn't satisfied, if she could return the items, and they said of course. She ended up purchasing the $300 cream and called me. I immediately found reviews of the Hermetise cream and found many other women had been conned with this same spiel around the country and Florida. Their claims are the cream they bought doesn't work as well as the cream they were shown in the store.

Adrianna Mayhan,US,"Oct 16, 2020","This is a scamThis is a scam. I was in Crabtree Valley Mall Raleigh NC and a girl came out of this store and boldly insisted she wipe some cream on my eye. She said "" COME IN COME IN "". She showed me some skin care and said it was $5000,00 but she really liked me as a friend and would give it to me for $400.00. I told her I did not have that much. She said since I was her friend she would give it to me for $300.00 and like a fool I bought it. Wentto pay and soon as they ran my card a girl came out of the back saying I will give you a free facial, I am a licensed dermatologist. I went back and laid on a table where for 45 long minutes she tried to convince me she wanted to seel me a $10,000 facial machine for $5,000.00 because she liked me and was my friend. She kept saying you have the money , I can tell by your jewelry. She got really mad at me and while I was trying to leave she insisted I must have this cream on after she used the machine on my face. I drove 1 hour and 30 minutes home and looked in the mirror and the left side of my face had droped like I had had a stroke. Its been 3 days now and my face is ruined. I believe when she got so mad at me for not buying the machine she put some chemical on me to cause harm. I should have got the Crabtree mall manager and gone to the police.Date of experience: October 16, 2020",1,Pharma

Tanja,CH,"Sep 25, 2020","Zurich Schop - disaster!Dark-haired, small, young lady approached me with the question: “Can I ask you, what kind of cosmetic products do you use?”. She was already behind me, and I wanted to be polite and turned back to her direction.Here is the conversation which took place afterwards: I asked: -Why are you asking me about products I use, this is private and very personal information? If you want to sell me something you can start from this point straight away. -I ask what I want and how I want, you understand?!!!-Why do you raise your voice? Any other ways to talk to people?-I speak how I want, and you don’t F*C* my day, just because of you are here!!!-The way you talk is disgusting. Where is your manager?-Get out of here!! Go away!!! I do my job, you understand?!!!I have insisted on talking to somebody from the store. The lady (sorry, hardly can call her … lady), took a cigarette and started to smoke in front of the shop with the colleague. Her hands were shaking, she was still screaming something on the street while I was in the shop. The young man started to talk to me. I have asked him, how is that possible to treat people and may be your future customers that way? How someone, who work for the company, sell the beauty products can use the word “f*c*” and shout at people? I have asked him to give me a name of that shouting woman. He has refused to give me her name… I asked why not? She is a member of the team, she works here, why do not give the name? He answered in a very primitive way:-        Because you want to do something bad. I do not want to give you the name.I said that I have the right to complain about services and quality provided in this city and country if I feel so, if you do not give her name, ok, give me the phone number and the name of the manager. He did not want to provide me that information. At the end he gave me the phone number and name. I am 99% sure, this was NOT his manager’s contact details. The shouting lady came back from her smoke. None of them were wearing the masks in the shop whole time I was there! She calmed a bit down, but started to attack me with the questions like: Who you are, and what kind of job are you doing?...As a fact, I have a good paying, but hard and responsible job. What about if I would not have one? Does it allow her to abuse me or someone else who does not have a job? …I was about to leave that strange place, and said that I will leave you now, but I will not leave it. They have to be responsible for what they do and say. Shouting lady started to apologize (loud, almost screaming) and the man, I was talking to, brought me…. You think what? Drink! Something strange, yellow in a small glass. This highlights their hospitality and a problem-solving solution, indeed! Does he really think I will drink it???!!!The staff do not speak German at all! Being in the centre of Zurich, they try to sell very expensive products in English, in their very rude, unprofessional, impolite way! Their English is “broken” too! Where did they get here from?!I hope the shouting-smoking-dark-haired lady will be fired very soon. There is no place to work for such abusers!I DO NOT accept the apologies and will contact a main office in the UK, will find out who is the manager and proceed with legal actions!

Malinda Maestas,US,"Sep 22, 2020","Extremely dissapointedAfter reading all the negative reviews I to was  scammed.  My mom, daughter and myself went to Sedona, AZ for a girls trip for mothers day and were pulled into the store by a very nice lady that wanted to show us her products.  She began by putting the wrinkle remover cream under my eyes and around my mouth.  It appeared to instantly remove wrinkles and and restore lost volume under my eyes.  I purchased 2 of the Hermetise wrinkle remover for $200 each and thought I was done.  Another gentlemen (Israel guy) pulled us to the back and started in on his sales pitch.  Very pushy, would not let us leave.  After about 2 hours I walked out spending about $1200.00.  I had such buyers remorse after leaving there that it ruined our girls day out.  After using the product at home, the results were not the same.  The Yubari King wrinkle remover was dried up and clumpy and left a residue.  The remaining products are still under my bathroom sink.  I am so upset with myself to be taken advantage of.  All the workers in the store were from another country and used the same high pressure sales tactics.Date of experience: September 22, 2020",1,Pharma

Zee,US,"Updated Sep 18, 2020","Hermatise scamLike some of the others here, I got sucked in and scammed.  I was walking through a hotel on the riverwalk in San Antonio and was aggressively approached by a you man.  He talked so fast I could hardly keep up, he started using some products on me.  Asked me my age and acted ‘surprised’ I was that old.  Proceeded to ise this product and that product and told me the ‘price’ and said he would sell it to me for ‘half price’, I thought that was a steal too.  My fiancé was there and he was just as gullible as me.  I asked this young man where he was from and he said Isreal where the Dead Sea is.  Then he started talking about it being the land of Jesus, which it is.  Didnt occur to me till later that evening when I started thinking about it, that he probably kept us suckered because he was trained to notice things that could rope us more in.  My fiancé has an I Love Jesus tattoo on his throat that was plainly seen.  This man then kept telling me that he didnt believe my age and wanted to see my drivers license, so I showed it to him and he didnt even look nor make a comment about my birth year.  AGAIN after going over it in my head later, he was probably disguising that so he could verify my identity to my card.  I had had dinner and some drinks so I was happy.  Normally I am very suspicious of people.  STUPID me got roped into $1800 worth.  That evening after thinking about this, I looked at my products and I had 3 different brands of stuff.  I started doing my research and found all but 2 products I could get off Amazon for under $100.  I was PISSED to say the least.  The next morning when I went to confront him, him and his buddies were gone.  I filed a dispute with my bank.  PLEASE WATCH OUT for people.  He said his name was Daniel and he gave me the phone # of 210-872-0591.  I haven’t called the number yet as I am waiting for the dispute.

The box included my most favorite items that I’ve been ordering consistently (that was such a lovely touch), replacements for damaged and missing products from my 2 previous orders, plus some more lovely gifts and samples. A few days after receiving this package Stephanie followed up with me to make sure I received everything and was satisfied with how the issues with my orders were resolved. Stephanie, thank you very much for taking care of it. ********4/28/2020 I’m really sad to leave such a poor review, even though I absolutely LOVE the product, their customer service is not very responsive. I received an order that was missing 1 item. I contacted customer service 3 times on 4/18, 4/20, 4/22 using their website inquire form and direct email. Today is 4/28 8pm and I haven’t heard back. I understand that during these unprecedented times responses might be delayed. But 10 day delay with NO update is quite frustrating.Date of experience: April 29, 2020",2,Pharma

When I was approached in the street to try out this cream I did not realise  the whole thing is a scam. The charming well trained Sales gentleman talked me into buying the cream After demonstrating the cream on my eyes which did show a vast improvement.  However on trying at home for one week now this cream does not work. If you put too much on you are left with tiny white globules on your skin and if you put very little, no difference at all,  on top of all this I was told I would  get a FREE trial of cream for wrinkles around my mouth.  I turned up the next day to be confronted by a lady with a clipboard wanting me to fill in a detailed form and then introduced to a Dr who tried very hard to persuade me to purchase materials at a cost of $7000+!

OK, I went along with it.  Then while having this facial selling session a very handsome man was telling me that this is so afordable for what the product does.  I told him several times, I was not going to spend $5000 on face creams etc.... He was very relentless,  ( that is good training on his part)  He was a very good salesman but would not let up at all.  I just wanted to go home.  But he kept perswading me to buy this line.  I kept telling him I could not afford it.  He wanted me to tell him about my finances and he would show me how I could afford to buy the product.  I was in this little room with him for almost 3 hours.  I needed to get back home.  All I wanted to do is walk around the mall.  He kept making deals for me and I felt like I was trapped.  I ended up feeling very wore down and just wanted to leave and bought the producdt line.  The next day, without even opening anything, I called and said I just cant do this it is just to expensive.

Stormy,US,"Updated Aug 22, 2024","Body Logic Franchise - Inflated PricingWhile I really like the Dr. I use, this review is for the larger machine (aka franchise - Body Logic which he works under). After being a loyal client for almost 2 years, Body Logic tacked on a $300 administrative fee with zero warning or notification. When you sign up with this company and take hormones, you are automatically committing to routine blood tests amongst other tests.  This is normal as they should be checking your serum levels routinely when you take hormones. However, now in addition to their already crazy high lab fees and urine test kits that I pay for out of pocket, Body Logic has decided to add on a $300 admin fee as well. It's ridiculous - I was warned about this place by other reviews that has similar comments and now it's happening to me. It's sad because I like my Dr that works under them very much, but I am very turned off by the larger functioning body logic franchise machine that you have to work through and their crazy prices and hidden fee's. I don't feel like a valued client to them even though I feel cared for by the Dr. in my area that represents them. It's also a bit confusing to get a hold of the right people since you are working through the franchise for some of the experience like lab work etc., Sadly, with these new admin fee add ons will be taking my business elsewhere.

I wanted to have increased energy and that has yet to happen.  I have been on this for 1 year now and the process of calling my Indy office is awful - hard to actually talk to a real person and the supplement order process is tedious at best.  Now, you have a new more confusing system to check on supplement orders and delivery .  I also think it is awful that you won't offer more support on how to receive partial payment from our Insurance companies. I have spent thousands of dollars and am not sure of the benefits.

I have managed my reorders by calling them in at least two weeks before needed, and over and over I've been frustrated with the time it takes to receive them.  I thought the new patient portal would help, but it changed nothing.  I can't track my orders.  I've had an order randomly cancelled and only realized it when I called customer service.  I have one supplement on backorder right now (7/14) that I ordered on 6/3 and ran out of around 7/1.  I've heard every reason from the FedEx shooting in Indianapolis to increased demand on the compounding pharmacies.  I pay a lot of money for this treatment and the supplements and am becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the ordering process.  I do have to say that the customer service reps help me as much as they can, and I hate to keep complaining to them because I know they have no control over the problems.

First of all, I see Dr. Archer, I really like her, she's sweet, listens to you and seems knowledgable and that is the only reason I didn't give it a one-star.  As for the company ""body-logic"" at every turn I have had a bad experience.  The communication is horrible, everything is micro-managed and I do not believe anyone knows what anyone else is doing or what is going on.  I was told at the first contact for this ""balance-pro program"" that it was a flat fee every 2 months and that everything was covered (labs, meds, MD fee) come to find out that the only meds that are ""covered"" by this ""plan"" is testoterone (and testosterone is cheap) so if you need any other hormone balancing meds (which I needed all of them and thyroid meds) they are not covered.  I find this out only after talking to 4 different people because no one either didn't know or wouldn't give me a straight answer.  You cannot find any written information on the website as to what this $600 actually provides you.  when I asked someone who works there why I cannot find any of the information or have not received any information in writing, I get no answer and they change the subject.  The Pharmacy side isn't any better, in my opinion, first of all it takes 7-10days to get to me (no I do not live in outer mongolia) and I have had to frequently call to see where my meds are, if they've even been shipped yet.  No apologies on that, by the way, just a ""oh, they should be shipping out today"" response.  I feel like every communication with them has been less than honest.  This ""patient portal"" is horrible you cannot find information on if your meds were shipped, what dosage meds you are on, or any labs results.

Concerned for others,US,"Jul 16, 2021Invited","Troubled by care providedI don't normally write reviews but I feel compelled to do so today. I have had a difficult journey working with BodyLogicMD. I have been working with them for over a year and have had little to no improvement. As it turns out, my last labs are now showing a decline in overall health. I thought when I started working with them I was going to get individualized treatment but It feels like a ""canned program"" instead of addressing actual individual concerns. At each visit the doctor had already decided what she is going to do next with my treatment, even before she had heard how I was doing on the last adjustments. It is hard to reach the doctor to ask questions, office staff are not easy to work with and astronomical fees are charged to get the required lab slips. They don't submit to insurance and require you to use only one pharmacy that charges on the higher side. At each visit I would explain my concerns and symptoms and receive a preplanned/prepared adjustment. When I would try to reach out to let the doctor know things were not going well between visits, I was met with the same thing....stay on track and we'll do lab work in 3 months and go from there. I am now at the point that my lab work is troublesome and I'm being recommended to go see my PCP so they can help correct my declining lab results. I thought BodyLogicMD was the specialist in this area? Very mixed messages are now taking place. At my last visit progress was praised in certain areas of my treatment in the beginning of the conversation and by the end was I being suggested to wean off everything, even the very things that were praised as doing well. I'm left questioning whether there is any expertise here. Even though I have done everything the doctor asked me to do over the past year, I feel now they are trying to get rid of me as a patient because the canned program isn't working for me? I'm so disappointed and frustrated. Have I just wasted a year and hundreds of dollars? I now have to start all over in a worse place then when I started with BodyLogicMD. I would not recommend them.Date of experience: July 16, 2021",1,Pharma

Lauren Bryant,US,"Sep 16, 2021","This company is a SCAMThis company is a SCAMThe at-home testing kit was incredibly inefficient. I had to send two different blood samples in, which I performed exactly to the instructions, only to be told twice that the cotton swabs did not have enough blood on them. I then had to go to a lab to have blood drawn so that their sample would be large enough.The company is also the equivalent of joining a gym membership that is impossible to cancel. They charged me a $600 flat fee which was supposed to include two virtual physician visits, an assessment of my blood/urine, and supplements. As it turned out, the supplements (besides the testosterone) cost extra - I was convinced that I should do a 14-day cleanse consisting of a $170 protein shake pack (surprise, there is no smaller/less expensive cleanse or brand that they offer), as well as other supplements which were not covered (no reason was given for this).I ordered all of the suggested supplements and adhered to the cleanse as best I could. I was specifically told that I would not be charged again without my consent. Yet Bodylogic did charge my credit card again $600 without any email or correspondence or notification whatsoever. When I discovered the charge, I advised Bodylogic that I did not want to continue paying $600 particularly since they had already collected samples from me and the supplements were extra. I also called my credit card company to have the fraudulent charge removed.When my credit card company contacted Bodylogic, the company outright lied to the credit card company and told them that it was not a recurring charge and that I had agreed to the charge. I have been stuck in an endless loop with Bodylogic and Chase trying to get the fraudulent $600 removed from my card, for which I have not received ANY services. Bottom line: do NOT use this company, they are a scam and will charge you exorbitant fees without your permission.Date of experience: September 16, 2021",1,Pharma

Sasha Jade,US,"Jul 16, 2021","If you are looking for a scam, this is it.If you are looking to add more stress to your life, and be scammed instantly with money withdrawn from your bank account in mere seconds, then this is the place for you. My first contact was with Sabrina Felix, who is slick as heck, continuously using words like “becoming part of the ‘family’” and that they want a 2 month commitment from you- not telling you that $700 would be taken out as soon as you hang up. I was livid and called so many times until I was finally told that “if I were to do all the labs separately and come in and see the doc in office, it would be cost way more.” I received my testing kit and was recommended a HRT plan. Two days ago I had a follow up which lasted about 15 minutes or so, and no sooner than 5 minutes after my follow up, $800 dollars was IMMEDIATELY withdrawn! I’ve been calling and emailing constantly- and getting transferred from one person to another and NOT ONE OF THEM could give me a breakdown of what the money was for, other than “that is the cost of the program you are on, and if labs were needed, it would be covered” which is EXACTLY what I was told the first time they took money out. I told them that my telehealth appointment was 15 minutes at best, and THERE ARE NO LABS needed to be done- so what is the breakdown of the charges?!” NOT ONE person could give me an answer except for the words “program” and “I’m not sure, I don’t work in that department.” So this morning I find a pending refund of $100! I call, and again the same thing- “ I don’t know what’s going on, I will let the supervisor know.” I am BEYOND angry, and beyond broke- and still left hanging with zero clue as to what the money is for. I didn’t do any additional testing, nor was it brought up…I also never heard ANYTHING regarding the withdrawal of $800 dollars- NONE OF THAT WAS talked about before my follow up appointment. I’m still waiting for a call, which I’m sure will not happen anytime soon…in the meantime, consider this a warning- save yourself all of this EXTRA stress, and a drained bank account by looking elsewhere….this place is a SCAM.

They are a box for home use with the packets.....My box for June was shipped FedEx and when I received the box the shrink wrap was opened and the contents were gone and, replaced with a dirty 1/2 bottle of ibuprofen and the box was taped back up! I have a huge issue with this as they print my full name on every packet that would be 60 packets. So who ever stole the supplements has my full name and address. I would think printing a name would be a HIPPA violation. I asked to have the person in charge of that department to call me on 2 different occasions...I never heard from him! I did speak to someone in that office, and I explained my concerns, that I did NOT want my name on the packets anymore and that the supplements need to be shipped in a shipping box, it's common sense!! I just received another box 2 days ago and NOTHING has changed! It was shipped the same way, my name is on all the packets!!! NOT HAPPY! Obviously no one took me seriously or my concerns! My identity could be stolen because of the way you ship things. If this should happen my attorney will be in touch with your company!

Amy Spencer,US,"Updated Dec 12, 2021","2 Month Update! Life is beautiful!I initially posted a review on October 19, 2021. It was a 3 star because there were positive AND negative things to share. So I did 3 stars for neutral.I must share my experience, up to now, not quite 2 months into my hormone replacement. To truly understand my incredible experience, you must know just how bad things were for me.I went through menopause early and for 10 years… same BS from my GYN… estrogen doses so low that I had no real benefit but my husband could penetrate me without searing pain and bleeding. But it still hurt and there has been no sexual pleasure, at all… for me. JUST pain, followed by many days of burning skin, frequent UTI and kidney infections (which I’ve never suffered from prior to menopause). And my GYN (a female) told me that this is the way it is now… accept it. She had added Testosterone at one point which made it possible to very rarely have a little positive sensation, which ultimately fell flat. Then there was the constant urinary leaking during the day and having to wake up several times every night. She wanted to refer me to a urologist, you know… maybe I need some medication or surgery! She retired and my next GYN, a man… actually listened to me and agreed that it’s not ok to have to engage in something that is painful, causes infections and resentment… and provides NOTHING positive… and it isn’t acceptable. He increased my doses. Still… minimal results. They generally won’t prescribe enough for real results because of CDC guidelines. It was a decade of deep frustration and sadness. Research, over the years led me to finally try Body Logic MD, of FL. It’s not even been 2 months and the difference is incredible. So… this is what I’ve noticed, so far. I asked my husband to leave sex OFF the table, for ONE full week on my new doses.Day 7… Sex did NOT hurt! It didn’t feel good but it didn’t hurt! I held my breath, waiting for the signs of a UTI/Kidney infection. By the end of week two, I exhaled. Nothing! By this point, I was already sleeping better as I was not waking up AT ALL, during the night, to use the bathroom. I can’t tell you how wonderful it is to wake up refreshed. When I am awake, I do still have to pee frequently but I don’t pee my pants if I can’t get to the bathroom right away! Almost 2 months now and still NO infections, sex is more regular and since it isn’t painful, I don’t feel resentful. I now even have SOME pleasure!My skin is soft again! Im not itchy all over, any more! I just had my second virtual appointment a few days ago, with Ms Lupinski and we discussed increasing my doses. YES! She said my estrogen receptors are waking up and the new doses will wake more of them up. So, my Estrogen, Progesterone and Testosterone have been increased and I think it’s going to be enough to achieve the results I seek. And the cost has not increased. Ladies, I highly recommend Body Logic MD of FL. I warn you, the Testosterone is injectable BUT… it’s EASY and it’s NOT painful!Body Logic MD has changed my life, drastically, in such a short time and my marriage, which was very healthy (though we struggled with the menopausal impact on physical intimacy) is experiencing a new excitement and joy!

The new program they have is terrible to access and have found that the new program over ride the old auto orders.

Good health is the foundation of a life that can be enjoyed. Dr. Okereke provides specific recommendations to improve your wellness using your own lab reports. Unlike your other doctors that always have their shoulders turned towards the door, she spends time explaining the lab results, what they mean to your health, and how those numbers can be improved to be the best you.  You are no longer guessing on whether you have the correct diet or supplementation because her recommendations are based upon your biochemistry and not some average USDA recommended daily allowance. Her five pillars of good health are nutrition, detoxification, exercise, hormone balance, and stress reduction & sleep.  If you want to enjoy your life, then you need mental clarity, and energy that lasts throughout the day and energy to be intimate with your partner.  Of course, you didn't get to your current health overnight and her guidance will not change your life overnight either, but if you follow her recommendations, then your age will become a number.  I am in the best shape of my life at age 52 with energy, mental sharpness, and vigor that I never experienced before.  If you want to the best you, then you need Dr. Okereke to guide you on a health journey that is unique to you.  Your health is greatest investment you'll ever make.

The vitamins are sent every 30 days regardless of how many pills are in the bottle. Some have 30, 60, 90 pills, but they send them every month. This month I received 2 bottles of Calcium and Omega. I now have 3 bottles of each. By the time that I finish the Omega pills, they will be stuck together and I will have to throw them out again. They said they have to send them every 30 days because the doctor wrote the prescription that way. I have asked Dr. Negrin to change the prescription twice.  Customer service said that they will send me a label to return that last order of Calcium and Omega. I haven't received that yet. I finally decided to remove the supplements so I won't get anymore until I need them. Hopefully, it won't be hard to renew the prescription in 3 months when I need them again. I get too many emails. I am unsubscribing to them, but they frequently ignore that. I miss the updating email from BodyLogicMD. I have automated many functions so I don't have to monitor everything. Auto Billpay. Auto order prescriptions. Why can't BodyLogicMD give me control when I get prescriptions?Sincerely, Joan NelsonDate of experience: July 08, 2021",3,Pharma

The Daimonds product page shows nice crystals on their website, but the tubs of wet, sticky gunk I got doesn't even remotely resemble crystals or powder. I later found a review site of others that received this gunk as far back as a last year. They don't let you know this and still have the pictures showing large crystals. I've never seen diamonds break down into a slimey liquid mush like this, and I've stored the same product for over a year with no problems. These people know what they are selling, they just refused to tell you before you buy it. The Vape Pens didn't leak while they were shipped to me. They were sent to me low. Maybe they are buying compromised product and reselling it? It looks like it now from my 2 experiences.

Charlie Jerome,US,"Sep 20, 2024","SENDING OUT UNSAFE PRODUCTS CONSISTENTLYI've been using Binoid since before they moved out of California, and even after the move things were fine for a while. But then I started getting expired products, vapes that taste like soap (which means incredibly bad storage practices at some point along the line). I've told them, made it very clear that these things are dangerous! They either offer to send a replacement or ask for product back but hey, it's almost like I have to use the things to know they taste like soap. Sick of this disregard for public safety from them, dunno if it's a new owner or what the is going on with these people but I will be looking elsewhere from now on.

Four days later look up the tracking and they still have not processed the order at USPS and they mailed it ground. I contact them and they tell me to come back tomorrow if it does not arrive.

I’ve sent three or four emails about a simple issue—wrong product sent, and I sent them proof! Yet here I am, almost a week later, with nothing but a single, vague “we’re working on it” response. What exactly is there to “work on”? I expected some kind of real solution, or at the very least a clear update, but all I get is radio silence.This whole situation screams that Bloomz only cares about taking your money and not about making things right when they mess up. They even threw out a $70 coupon that doesn’t work—just an empty gesture, like everything else they’ve done. I get the feeling that when they saw my product was out of stock, they just tossed in whatever they had lying around, hoping I’d accept it. It’s honestly insulting to be treated this way. I’ve tried to stay professional, but their complete lack of accountability and decency makes that almost impossible. I paid for the right product and prompt service, and I shouldn’t have to chase down the company for what’s fair. Bloomz, you might make good flower, but your customer service is the absolute worst—impossible to stay loyal to a company that treats its customers like an afterthought.All I wish is for them to go bankruptcy... so other people don't have to go through this kind of service.IF YOU STILL DECIDE TO BUY FROM THEM, JUST BUY THE BUDGET STRAIN.

Loyal Customer,US,"Feb 3, 2024","In response to some bad reviews about…In response to some bad reviews about orders:My elderly mother and I have been Binoid customers for years. I’m mid west, she is Cali. We buy mostly CBD/THC blends. We utilize their point system and discounts and get free product almost every time we order. I’ve had a few hiccups with orders but it occurs usually between the order, and then getting the product to the mailing station (my orders come out of Florida) so my guess is an employee (possibly the mailing station) is pocketing orders occasionally on the way to the station because my orders are usually $200-ish. Happens to all companies everywhere and yet, everytime this has happened (maybe twice in two years) they sent a completely new order after a few days of watching tracking. That is a complete loss of $200 to them to replace my order that never made it to the station. Just to make me happy and get my product which shows they are ethically sound. If you have had a bad experience or lost an order (as some of the bad reviews state) just email them and give them the order number. From years of experience, they play it straight so if you had issues with them over this, you might wanna reflect on how you are handling it.

The smell and flavor was super off and synthetic. Kind of smelled like a bad perfume. The flavor was just as bad and it left a nasty coating in my mouth/throat. It irritated my throat and lungs in a way I have never experienced with other hemp flower. Effects were very short lived and hard to describe, but kind of just made me stupid and unaware for like 15-20 minutes. I threw the whole bag in the trash after barely smoking any, likely saving myself from who knows what kind of awful mental hell/withdrawals.

A week later, I decided to just go ahead and leave a review on the product and I wrote exactly what I said to customer service. I got an email to ""verify my email for my review"" so I did. Then I went to look at my review and it was gone. So I did some digging online and found out that other people have also had their reviews deleted for giving under a 3 star rating.

Michael Ludtke,US,"Oct 15, 2023","They pull the negative reviews so you don't find out their stuff is wack before you buy itI've had two experiences with Binoid. Both bad. The first time I ordered the THC-P dabs. Super weak, super harsh, tasted awful, pretty much D8 with traces of other things. I had no intention of ordering from them again, as I still have a couple of those from the 6 pack I got over a year ago unopened due to their suckiness. No interest in using them. Fast forward to last week, they send me a random 50% off anything coupon in my email. I saw that they have THC-A diamonds and thought ""oh, this is literally just pressurized isolate, how bad could they mess it up""? Well, I got it yesterday and it's not even diamonds. It's a powdery wad of goo that tastes like lip gloss and burns like fire in your lungs. It has the same consistency as their THC-P dabs and about as much burn. Truly a crappy product, it's like they mashed up some chunky isolate into artificially flavored distillate. I left a review expressing my disappointment and they immediately took it down. The reason none of their products have bad reviews is bc they pull them and only leave up the 4 and 5 star ones from beginners who don't live in legal states and don't know better. Dishonest (and bad) products and dishonest review system. No good.Date of experience: October 14, 2023",1,Pharma

I can assure they are dogsh!t all that stuff is some fake chemicals and most likely pesticides and heavy metals. All of their labs are faked they just make that sh!t up and don’t even include what a lab should test for, tried hpp and thc-p supposedly the strongest cannabinoid at the time I tried em, which I’m sure these aren’t even the actual cannabinoids themselves just untested harmful chemicals, but the only affects were a bit relaxed if even but not anything to speak about, maybe the effects are different for none smokers but your still hurting yourself, when I tried thc-p my kidneys started hurting which is something that has never happened before or after so I mean I wouldn’t trust em at all but if you trust a company who deletes negative comments on their site be my guest. Tbh either get a medical card or buy thca flower and sh!t from a verified legit brand, there are some, but just not Binoid it’s just a waste of your money and is most likely slowly but seriously damaging you, look up long term effects of heavy metals.

I suffer from severe compound CPTSD, and so I am a highly anxious person at all times. I used to smoke marijuana, but I couldn’t do it all the time because it was really intense, and if I tried the wrong strain, it even could cause worse anxiety. For anyone who suffers from PTSD or severe anxiety, I highly recommend the strain “Blue Dream”! I feel so much more comfortable using a legal product, and having the ability to pick and chose what strains help me! Also, I can use it anytime of the day or night and still be productive! I love that this company gives an abundance of details about their process and commitment to helping people. They are very friendly, and quick to respond to questions. Besides, I always buy enough (even though the minimum isn’t high at all) for free and fast shipping! The reviews are great too! They help me decide what might work for me or not. I personally like the Delta 8 vapes, gummies, chocolate, and tinctures the best so far, but I’ve only tried the Blueberry Pie THC-O gummies, which definitely have some extra buzz, but I haven’t explored all of the products yet. Oh, I did try the “Shroomz” which were amazing. Those are really strong though, so I only take a bit at night. The tinctures are very helpful for my chronic pain issues too. Believe me, I could go on and on about how Binoid has helped me and made my quality of life better!

We usually order from another company, but they were sold out. My order came a day sooner than expected...however the bottles in the package were something completely different. Not the same blend. Not even the same flavor. I took a picture and sent them an email with pictures. They sent me an email the next day saying I can keep the bottles and they will charge me half the price, or they can get me a return label and I can mail them back. I told them I would like what I originally ordered, and would send the wrong bottles back. That was sent at 8AM....nothing. No answers back until the next day. They sent a return label and said they were shipping what I originally ordered. So now I have to make a trip into town to return something they messed up on. At least they are sending me what I originally ordered, but, checking the tracking number, it will end up being over a week later than it was originally supposed to be here. My favorite place got theirs back in stock so I ordered from there...they will be here tomorrow...with cheaper shipping. I will not be ordering from this place again.

Well, lo and behold, November 14th rolls around and they still haven't even packaged my order. I talk to someone on chat who says that they need pictures of my ID and my credit card to keep from being defrauded and that that's why my order hasn't been packaged, even though they charged me the full amount for my order and never sent me an email about it. In fact, they then argued with me that they had sent me an email (they had in fact sent me 6 emails, none of them about fraud) so I started listing the subject lines of the emails that they had sent until they suggest that it might be in my spam folder - it was not. They had not sent one. I checked. Finally I just ask to get a refund, and am told that it will take 7-15 days to process it. If you never sent the item and never intended to, why did you even charge my card in the first place? Why did you then keep the charge? Why did you then wait until I contacted you, lie to me about saying you emailed me and say that you were worried I was defrauding you, and then tell me that I would have to wait 1-2 weeks for my refund to process?

Not Listed,US,"Sep 10, 2024","NightmareUSPS lost TWO of my orders from BINOID and they refused to help even though the package receiver cannot file a claim for a lost package. I paid extra for Priority mail (they charged me considerably more than the actual cost of shipping) and after over a week of nothing (it should only takes 3 days to get a package from them) I contacted them and was totally ignored. I had to go ballistic just to get a single super short response telling me to to wait (that's it) EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOW GOING INTO WEEK 2 AND USPS TOLD ME (and I relayed to Binoid) USPS CAN'T FIND IT AND TO HAVE THE SHIPPER CONTACT THEM TO FILE A LOST PACKAGE REPORT AND A CLAIM USING FOR THE INSURANCE! Did they do a single other thing to help resolve this? Nope, nothing and so now I am out a huge amount of money. The only way I'll ever get anything from them is by doing a chargeback with my bank, that's how ghastly Binoid is and how little they care about customers once they have our money. I have been reading a lot of posts about them going under so maybe they can't afford to refund me? I don't know, all I know is they have treated me like crap even though I have spent thousands with them and was a terrific customer who left glowing reviews for them and their products. Binoid is rude, quality is poor, prices are way too high, some products are described as oils/tinctures that are totally safe and intended specifically for consumption, but when you receive it, it says in big print on the side, DO NOT CONSUME, NOT SAFE! shipping charges are way above actual cost, and they seem to hate their customers. This is the worst business I have ever dealt with. Before ordering from them, have them send you pictures of the labels so you can see if it really is edible or not before you buy. When I asked them about this, they totally ignored me. When I posted this concern as part of an otherwise positive review, they deleted it. In other words, they're selling products as edible hoping no one will read the safety warnings on the box explicitly telling people not to eat or consume this product, it's only to be used as a ""scent"" in an oil vaporizer device intended for scented oils. This is the kind of dirty, disgusting, disreputable business they are - they only care about money - not their customers or their health. All I wanted was what I paid for and not only did I never receive it, they treated me like crap and they ate $40 worth of points in my account. When I contacted them for help, they did nothing. Between this, the two lost orders, and the products I had to throw away because they were not edible as described or safe to consume in any way, I have lost hundreds and hundreds of dollars using Binoid. I am a very loyal customer, but not that loyal, I am done with this scammer business and moving on to doing a chargeback, warning others, and reporting Binoid for the laws they have repeatedly broken to every state and federal organization I can find. All they had to do is engage in decent communication, make sure my points were returned, and make sure I get everything I paid for. That's it, pretty darned reasonable and they refused to do ANY of those things. Binoid - the worst business in this entire industry.Date of experience: September 09, 2024",1,Pharma

They confirmed that it is their order number. It is their tracking number my information , my credit card statement does not have any other payments going to anybody so that means this company either ships products for free.. or they are involved with this company who happens to sound like it’s the same industry what better way to way over charge and split it there’s still making more money than my $69 order. I said this seems like a problem not problem because if you’re saying that I have to contact them and, you sent this to me and you want me to refuse and Center so you can get my order back but yeah nobody’s looking into this money to get me back. That means anyone who is a customer of this company should be very concerned that this company is sharing their customers , private information with this so entity that they won’t look into it for you or file a fraudulent alert or notify their customers that their information may be jeopardized or offer to put a fraud alert on all of their customers why all of their customers have to pay additional fees for either  a fraudulent company that is in cahoots with this entity in the same field and again I was never charged for the products that they shipped to me only one charge for this whole entire month and kind of ironic the same industry, but nobody knows who they are and they won’t look into it. They won’t file police report. I gave them numerous opportunities to try and resolve this or at least start trying to resolve it before I posted any kind of plan , and yes, I did not give them that much time because I thought about it if I didn’t have a credit limit set on my card that notified me about an unusual purchase I wouldn’t have known until I got my statement and then I would’ve been really out of luck so I will be letting the Better Business Bureau and this company  has us out facial and one of them will be giving me my $200 back but this is a company problem not an individual problem. Anyone who has ever ordered from this company. Please check your credit card statements or banking statements and please please ask your credit card to send you a new card. Your information was compromised by this company. Date of experience: October 09, 2024",1,Pharma

I have been ordering from them for several years and have been very pleased with what I order for how I use the food (mostly maintenance and occasional weight loss tune up). My last order was not what I have come to expect. My order was two days late and no longer frozen but still cold. I'm not sure if this is the reason that now when I cook the chicken sticks while they are normally plump and moist this batch seems dry and stiff. I will still eat them because like cold pizza, it's still pizza so I will eat it. Anyway in addition to the late and not frozen order I was missing 30 of the Nashville Chicken Sticks that were to be included. This was not really a problem because they were promptly shipped to me. When these arrived they were still frozen and when I cook them they are exactly how they should be, plump and moist (moist is the kind of word that if said often enough it doesn't sound like a work anymore) :).Anyway this review is only 3 stars but normally I would give 5 stars.Date of experience: June 22, 2022",3,Pharma

Wendy Rushing,US,"May 23, 2022Verified","Delicious. Great Value. QuickI purchased this food program 2 + weeks ago along with the fasting option. I just started 3 days ago. I’m not rich and this is a great value & surprisingly delicious. I eat on the run between my office, appointments and home office. I eat a lot of junk food and fast food & have gained 33 pounds since last July (knee injury too). I love good food I just don’t want to cook it for one.  Along with extra vegetables (which they offer also) these portions fill me up. I love the spicy options. There is also a list of foods I can eat that are not part of the program. Baked Apple with cinnamon for my sweet tooth, salad, tuna etc. The best part is they heat up in two minutes or less. I am also allergic to shellfish & nuts and have several food sensitivities like wheat, corn & yeast. This program allows me to avoid those while still staying satisfied. My goal is 50 pounds down & in 3 days I’ve lost 6.  That is without the fasting because I forgot to do it.Date of experience: May 23, 2022",5,Pharma

I love eggs but I need to eat oatmeal with fruit or a little monk fruit, best sweetener ever, at least three days a week.  I love the fact that I don’t have to  worry about cooking all the time.  I can now concentrate on my health and exercise. Not to mention we no longer waste food and we spend about the same amount of money on food if not less.However, I shop all organic and grass fed beef. That’s why I spend more when I do the shopping. I’ve been on the personal Trainer three weeks now and I’ve already lost 10 pounds when I take my water pills. I haven’t seen that weight in ten years!

The option to order just lunch and dinner is wonderful, as our breakfast consists of us frying some eggs and adding a meat with it.Sticking strictly to the diet in the first 2 weeks is essential. I lost 11 pounds during that time (12 days so far) while also training myself to avoid sugar, limit carbs, and make my meals out of one protein and then very veggie friendly. Being a 230 lb man, I found the meal size a bit small but will add more veggies to my meals and ultimately a bit more protein.  Compared to other diets I have tried this one gives you a greater meal size.I combined exercise with the diet and so far feel healthier and stronger. The lack of sugar and carbs has given me more energy.  Shipping was prompt and all items were enclosed in the large cooler.  So far it has been really productive.Date of experience: March 16, 2022",4,Pharma

Third and final time I’ve had to endure anxiety with delivery arriving as scheduled (1-2 days late). If your choice for logistics service can’t come through consistently then pick another source! Too many concerns with food spoiling if your shipping company can’t commit to an arrival date and speedy but I also can’t be waiting around my house for days waiting for the food to show up. Most recently PTF asked for forgiveness and asked if it was OK to delay my shipment for one week (claiming holiday disruption) and they STILL didn’t meet the delayed shipment date, by two days! When I reached out to customer service to tell them it’s NOT OK because I won’t be home I received no response. I’ll be coming home to rotten food on my porch that should have arrived as originally intended. It’s a shame, food is tasty and it helps dieters stay consistent just wish this company could offer the same consistency with shipments.

Also, at first on the aggression I would have said it hasn't helped at all as she is very jealous of attention given to our other dog, but lately there are some days we have noticed that she doesn't come running at us barking and pushing her way at us so we give her the attention instead. Yesterday she just sat on my lap and let me pet our other dog and show love to her without barking and carrying on like she would have done before.  We have only been giving it to her two times a day. She will have to continue doing that and not getting so worked up barking so crazy when we have storms and chasing the cats everytime she sees one walk across the floor before we would continue paying $36.00+/- every month for it as we are also suffering from the cost of living problems too.

I do not have credit with this company and everything is paid in advance so this is clearly a clerical error in their part.  The fact that they never bothered to reach out to me is ridiculous .

Marie Suhl,US,"Mar 24, 2022Verified","Mostly Good.For the first time in her life my senior fur baby Daisy was afflicted with allergies that started in the fall. Severe nasal congestion, sneezing, coughing, and the all dreaded reverse sneeze. Daisy had a rhinoscopy which thankfully showed no illness or growth was the cause. But that left us with no plan of definative action, so for months now my vet and I are trying different treatments consisting of both pharmaceutical and holistic treatments, as well as reducing any possible environmental triggers, which means I have to deep clean my house every two weeks (using just vinegar and no harsh chemicals). Nothing so far has been able to clear her congestion and combat the allergens allowing her to breath easily. I have tried using the sinus and respiratory meds from Native Remedies for 36 days now, and although they have not cleared the congestion the combined meds help keep the sinus from getting an infection which could easily progress to the lungs. The only negative I have is that these are expensive products and at a max dose there is only an 18 day supply per bottle and it's not always in stock. Treatment for a symptom that you don't know the cause for can take months or years and when combined with other treatments it's hard to determine actual benefits.

Rebecca,US,"Updated Nov 26, 2024Verified","Update - a good company, took great care shipping, been challenging to return but is getting sorted out, seller certainly responsive!I wanted a different product, and have been asking to return what I was sent and I have been *unable* to receive the information for a return. I've asked multiple times and have been ghosted by the company at this point. I was very optimistic and loved the care they took in sending the order but would sadly not advise anyone to order from HerbsPro given the seemingly false advertising when it comes to 'no questions asked' returns. A bummer, seems like a good company but buyer beware, we are now stuck with our order and out the money it seems.Updated- I’ve sent the return in but it seems from this message that the seller has not received it. I appreciated the response and ability to return. Seems like a fine company, would’ve been great, packaged really nicely, just not the product we’d wanted. Not the company’s fault and again I have indeed returned the shipment via usps and the return label, so not my fault either for the delay. Really hoping this puts an end to this. Am certain that others would have a wonderful experience, they took great care shipping. I have simply had a more frustrating and less than delightful experience. I’m sure it is just my own situation. They have certainly responded to the return. Hoping usps gets it to them shortly. Thanks. Date of experience: November 18, 2024",3,Pharma

I previously used the product they shipped, and I do not want it, and I did not order it. I could have ordered the STYLE beard balm from other places at a lower price, but I chose to pay more for the GROOMING beard balm from HerbsPro.

If I would have been informed that this was the issue, I would have waited and not been this frustrated. Please communicate with your customers when they send you emails. Thank you. I will change my rating to a positive one now that I have an explanation of what to expect. Update: A few hours after I wrote this review, the company shipped one of three bottles. Although I am glad I finally have one bottle on the way, I am still in limbo with the other part of my order and refund for the two bottles that did not ship. When will I receive my refund for the two out of stock unshipped items? This is where email updates would be very useful to the customer.Where do I begin with this horrible experience? I ordered 3 bottles of a vitamin supplement they said they had in stock. It said the item (s) would ship the same day. Days go by, I never receive any sort of shipping confirmation. I email them. I don't hear back. It took one email per day for 4 days to even get one response back. When I finally heard back, the person told me to be patient and wait 1 to 2 more days for shipping. I wait 3 days. I contact them again. They email me back and tell me to wait 1 to 2 more business days again. I wait. I contact them again inquiring about my package and why it hasn't shipped after two weeks.  I go back on their website and notice how they switched it to out of stock. So, I email them telling them to refund me. They ignore my emails. I have no refund. This product is completely discontinued and will never be in stock again. I told them if I didn't hear back from them and receive my refund of $60+ , I would file a report on reportfraud.ftc.gov. I have read too many comments on this website and multiple other review sites where this company doesn't have a product in stock, they ignore emails and do not refund the money or take entirely too long to do so. I check my spam folder every day, and they have yet to respond to me about my unshipped products and refund of my own money. This is very unprofessional. A little communication would go a long way to keep the customer updated on what is actually happening with their order, instead of continually telling customer to wait 1 to 2 more days.

They also recently sent out an email to their listserv that markets these new gummy cubes as a ""better"" version of their old CBD gummies.  However, the new ones are NOT organic, they are NOT non-GMO, and they now use corn syrup as a main ingredient.  Since I am allergic to corn I could not buy these, but my mom did and they smelled rancid.  Her dogs wouldn't even eat them.  When she posted a review on their website, it was removed the next day.

Next day I received yet more SPAM from them. In short, they target people at random, fill up the inboxes of people who have no interest in their product, do not keep their promises, and lie. For me, that's a 1-star performance. (I have the complete email thread as proof.)Update November 2024:On May 30 I received confirmation that ""your contact information will be permanently removed from our databases immediately. You won't receive any further emails from us."" Guess what - on Nov 22 I received Black Friday marketing email (SPAM). My complaint to the customer service is as yet unanswered. Nov 24 I have received further SPAM. Clearly this company, either willfully or through incompetence, populates its databases with harvested email addresses and never truly purges those databases, even when requested, and even when they promise. This merely adds weight to the title of this review.Date of experience: May 22, 2024",1,Pharma

And they will be delayed a couple of days. 14 days later they haven't even been mailed but they gladly charged my card when they got my order. If you do not have supply to cover the demand, offering a 25% discount on more is not going to fix the problem. I am not going to order more when I can't get the ones I already ordered.

Garlin Lewis,US,"Sep 26, 2022Redirected","CBD salve review. Great products for pain.Bought the 1,000mg extra strength salve from a local cbd shop to help with my back and neck pain. Took away my pain in about 10 minutes and the relief lasted about 3 hrs. It has a peppermint like smell. Loved the smell. I decided to order the 2,000mg maximum strength salve to get the maximum benefit from the pain relief and hope the relief last longer. I still get relief within 10 minutes, but I think the relief is not as good as the 1,000mg extra strength for some reason. Also, there is a distinct smell of hemp. Which is strong. I think I’m going to go back to the 1,000mg extra strength. I think I understand why it smells so strong because its double the strength, so overall the products work very well.

I offered to send product back, they said I would get a partial refund (which I have since received). I did not react to the lotion but have not had pain relief either. My rating is not because I can’t take the product because honestly some people just can’t. My low rating is because it took too long for them to confirm anything about a refund other than an automatic response to my request on 2-23-23, and no one even asked if I was better now or seemed concerned that I had such a bad reaction or even thanked me for describing the reaction for their potential investigation into it. That is why the company gets a lower rating from me. The product is probably great for anyone else. I am over 60 with arthritis and stress and had hoped this was an answer. For me it isn’t, but I suggest sample options for people like me who want to be careful before buying. I would pay for a sample of products first if I had seen the option.Date of experience: February 21, 2023",3,Pharma

The first night I took one gummie about 30 minutes before I went to bed. I did not feel any real benefit and my sleep was not very good.

I like using the vape process but it would be nice if the  $$$ discount would give a code instead of click for coupon which I don't receive  the amount offered. I have cactus cooler I am starting in a.m. I hope it works for me then I have the blueberry og or kush along with sour D after that it will leave me 4 more to try until I get the one that works for me. I like the delivery system for full spectrum cbd since I can get away from gummies because I am a type 1 diabetic and to not use sugar that's great. But, it would be nice to get some vape samples that could have 3 or 4 doses at 2 puffs each so that could help me in finding the best vape for me. I did get a call from a young lady that could not really answer me about the pain I have and which vape. Delivery would be good for me, and help me with the pain in my mid back after 10 surgeries and all she had said is what I had already read on the web site. I do like the vape delivery she could not even answer questions on battery life. Anyway all together I  ❤️  the system it is getting the vape product that will work for me.

I've ordered from other companies in the past and so far Cheef is the best quality. I'm amazed, I thought CBD flower was working for me before but the quality of this is like 10 times better than what I had before. My very favorite is Northern lights. I can't say enough good things about it. It keeps me calm but most of all I sleep better than ever when I smoke some before bed. This is the best I've ever had, EVER! I've already ordered more of Northern Lights because I don't want to be without! Skywalker OG is my second favorite, it keeps me calm for sure, helps my anxiety. It doesn't help me to sleep well though like Northern lights does. Zkittles tastes amazing but unfortunately its not for me. It made me feel like I smoked sativa, which makes my anxiety worse. It just gave me a jittery feeling that I wasn't fond of. Easily fixable with a bowl of Northern lights or Skywalker lol but Zkittles isn't one I'd personally purchase again. Clearly every strain works differently for each individual so try it for yourself for sure! Overall my experience with cheef has been great! I wish their shipping was as fast as some of the other CBD companies though. It took about 5 days to come where other CBD companies I've ordered from that are in the same area or a state or 2 over have taken 2 days.

This is an exact quote ""in this situation we prefer to refund and be done with this."" All i wanted was what i ordered which was 4 orders of their wax not melted into a puddle.

Long story short there are plenty of cbd companies that sell high quality cbd, yoy're not the only one Cheef.  Remember when I said they never admitted they knew exactly what happened,At the end of this ordeal I was contacted by a customer service manager or something and she admitted ""yes we are aware that warm weather can affect our concentrates and we are working to resolve this PROBLEM"". This is something that each and every customer should be warned about before their order processes. They are obviously in need of sales b/c there was a month or 2 in between this order and the one before so they sent me an email titled "" is this the end"" with a coupon begging me to order again.

I trying to get a return label by phone or email no answer and no response.I purchased four packages of these mushrooms, three are not opened I would like to return and I can't even get a hold of anyone for 2 weeks.  I read the other recent reviews here, others are having the same problem they don't answer anything, don't answer their phone or email if you have a problem.  Ironically before I place the order I had a question and they answered fast via email by the next morning of my email, they're choosing not to answer any return product emails or phone calls.  I would have been repeat customer if it weren't for this, avoid this company all costs. $160 order no money back guarantee response ,no answer for a return label, nothing.  They don't answer their phone and they don't answer their email when you have a return request.  I received an automatic response for the return, saying someone who would get back to me when 24 to 48 hours its now been 2 weeks with many emails sent since, and phone calls where I left a message which is the only option since they don't answer the phone.Avoid this company, there are many good CBD and Amanita Mushroom companies that won't rip you off like this.  If they would have just accept my return I could understand a bad product, and I would still order l, but not after this they don't answer any phone calls or email if you have a problem.I had to get my money back from my credit card company, because of no response from them.  Look into the other reviews recently they have done the same to others.And absolutely do not order Aminita muscaria mushrooms they're absolutely bogus, old, dirty and too dry and broken.Date of experience: December 23, 2023",1,Pharma

customer,US,"Mar 26, 2023","A Wonderful Discovery That Changed My LifeI discovered Cheef Botanicals by sheer accident. I was taking CBD gummies alongside my depression medication for years, which helped a lot. However, I was curious if there was flower that existed which was strictly CBD. Because quite frankly I miss smoking marijuana but I do not like how THC makes me feel. The reason is that whenever I smoke marijuana with THC it's like all the negative things I think about myself go to the forefront of my mind and then that's all I can think about. It is one of the main reasons why I stopped smoking marijuana.So obviously when I purchased flower from Cheef Botanicals I was skeptical because I was not sure if there truly was flower with just straight CBD. When my 4g of Northern Lights (my personal favorite strain from back in the day alongside white widow, which I hope Cheef Botanicals sells one day) and OG Skywalker arrived I spent the next couple of days smoking each flower when I wanted to relax or felt anxious.I was pleasantly surprised that the flower worked better than the CBD gummies that I had been taking for years and that it truly was just CBD flower. It was an incredible experience to be smoking flower again and to not be getting high, and instead experiencing the relaxation that came with regular marijuana.For the first time since 2010/11 I was back to smoking flower again because I was finally comfortable with it again.What also blew my mind was the absolute sheer quality of the flower that Cheef has. It was sticky, dank, and tasted so good. The color of the flower was absolutely beautiful. I had no idea that straight CBD flower could have any of these qualities. Their flower reminded me a lot of the high quality flower that's available at dispensaries throughout Massachusetts.The packaging too was incredible. One of the hardest things for me back in the day was keeping marijuana fresh. Well the container that the flower comes in is air tight, you can see into the container from the outside but its tinted to keep light out, and they have stay fresh packets inside to keep the flower fresh. It helped me to store my flower safely and not have to worry about having to use it up so quickly.I do miss smoking marijuana with THC, but my mind just cannot handle it anymore. But now I have marijuana with CBD. I truly cannot thank Cheef enough for giving me back something that used to bring me so much joy so long ago.I am now forever a customer and I would highly recommend their flower for anyone like me who misses smoking but cannot handle THC anymore.Date of experience: March 21, 2023",5,Pharma

William,US,"Jan 15, 2024","Buyer Beware!They won't leave this on their site trust, truth hurts. My Buyer Beware. They set the bar super high with this particular product. If you read the words in how they're describing what this does the effects are a surefire guarantee. All hype in my personal opinion. They say if you're new and never tried it, not familiar you might want to take ""half of one"" because they're so very potent? Laughable! I started with three on an empty stomach and felt nothing. Last two with food felt nothing. I will say it tasted like a basic kid's gummy maybe a bit better than the average but zero effect zero medicine meaning (Amanita D-9 THC +THCP)  this threesome didn't work at all. 1 to 10 score -1 for lack of all things regarding any effects or just feeling elevated fat zero! There was no mood altering effects for what was just pure candy. Candy doesn't help this mans needs in any department. But whoever does their marketing pitch for this stuff and wrote it up for their website a thousand percent oversold on the properties of what this supposedly can do or will do. There word's verbatim ""Your satisfaction is of the upmost importance to us and we want to deserve your 5-star rating. If you are in any way dissatisfied with your purchase, please don't hesitate to contact us. We would be more than happy to assist you with any questions or concerns."" Yes initially they'll respond back via email a few times and seem to care and give you the feel there a legitimate company who's on it and will fix the issue. But once I called them out on their own refund policy in which they basically saying verbatim off of their site:""If your product(s) has been open or used, no problem, we can still refund you if you are unsatisfied with your purchase, just fill out the Refund Request Form first"" .So in reading that it gave me a false sense of security of making a purchase and taking a chance on them. Once I tried communicating about my refund and filling out the form as they asked in which they get back to you within 24 to 48 hours it's been long past that at this point. All the good communication now has stopped nobody wants to keep their word in reference to my refund or appeasement and I just find that pretty disgustingly fraudulent. They say even if the product was used and I told them that I have the empty package to send if they really need back empty trash that's what I'll send them No problem. But keeping your Honest WORD as a so-called business should truly mean everything to them underneath it All. I don't think it does. And until this matter is settled respectfully they have earned my right to put them on a steady bright blast with the most negative spotlight that I can paint ""truthfully"" to help the next person not get ripped off in this way! I purchased this product Dec 31, 23 and today's date is the 15th of January 24. Yes you're truly showing just how upmost importance my business is to you by running away like the common drug dealing corner crooks @""Cheef Botanicals.P.S. Please know when I used my credit card it was for a one time to see if this works. When trying to take my card off the website it wouldn't allow me to. I received this message verbatim: ""That payment method cannot be deleted because it is linked to an automatic subscription. Please add a payment method, before trying again."" I had to go through the hassle of getting it taken off ASAP. I don't want my card linked to ineffective gummy candy charges every month? That's stupidly unprofessional of them why would I want to buy for the next month when I don't even know if your product even works first? The fact that it absolutely wasn't working makes this whole thing more rip you off fraudulent.Date of experience: December 31, 2023",1,Pharma

Aly,US,"Jan 28, 2022Verified","Not recommended for anxiety!!! Makes you drowsyI bought Cheef’s CBD Gummies (no THC) with high hopes that they would help with my severe social anxiety while ate work, and during the day. Taking these make me very drowsy and unable to focus. Almost like a sleepy/ confused high. Since I had initially bought them for every day use, I am giving the low rating. They say they offer a money back guarantee, but their request form doesn’t populate when you open it. They say you have to use the product for 30 days, but if you use more than 30% of the product, it doesn’t qualify for a refund. I’m sorry, what? …. The gummies taste a little hempy and medicinal, but in a good way. They’re a good solution for someone who has trouble sleeping. Unfortunately, these are not good for people with anxiety since you can’t use them during the day. Sadly, this defeats their purpose in my opinion.Date of experience: January 28, 2022",2,Pharma
CBD user,US,"Jan 25, 2022Verified","Bring back your caramels and I will become a customer again.I loved cheef chews CBD caramels and felt they worked very well so was hoping the new products would be as good. The gummies are not what I desire. The pieces are huge and covered with huge sugar crystals. I felt my teeth dissolving every time I ate a gummy. I’m taking CBD to ease pain, not to enjoy candy. It was all too much, too much sugar, too large pieces, and too many flavors to choke down to get my daily dose of pain relief. I prefer a much smaller “punchy” gummy in a tray but those products lost quality too. I now take nano technology products that are working for me.

Justin “the mad mick” michael,US,"Mar 30, 2023Verified","I’m only gonna point out the bad things because everything else is perfect with this company, their products, and their services.(Bare with me because I’m only going for the bad things here) So for starters, unless the customer pays for literally any other type of shipping other then the free one offered, they will wait for, at the least, 10-12 days before SW ships it to them. It’s almost as if they are punishing the customer for not paying for faster shipping instead of taking the free option. Second, the prices can be kinda high compared to several other supplement websites I’ve cross referenced with. SW does however offer some rather useful and cost worthy discounts and coupons so if your lucky enough to be able to use them before they expire, which doesn’t take long keep in mind, then they can make your purchase significantly lower. Lastly, and I saved this one for last due to the fact that I’m not 100% sure on this one, it seems like trying to get any type of refund on a product is going to be a bit of a pain in the ass. It looks like it’s gonna be one of those situations where your gonna have to find someone you can actually speak with person to person before you’ll get any type of help with this service.Date of experience: March 15, 2023",3,Pharma

Jeff Pellegrino,US,"Updated Dec 21, 2022Verified","Black Friday freebies not recieved! 2 messages, still nothing.I never received my shaker bottle and samples for spending $150 on black Friday. I messaged twice and to no avail. Otherwise this is a good place to shop. I will be back, but I guess this is what happens when you don't make your customers happy by making good on a black Friday offer.Just an update, I should have mentioned that customer service DID tell me that there was a green check box that I needed to check, which said something like ""yes I want my free items"".But in my defense, and I still have their Black Friday Solicitation e-mail, and it says the following, this is an exact quote: ""Black Friday Sale 20% off +Free shaker and samples w/purchase over $149"". Then at the bottom of the e-mail in fine print it says: ""* Sale Runs 11/21 - 11/28. This sale cannot be used in combination with other sales, promos, coupon codes, or special offers. Cannot be used on Bars, Stacks, RTD's or Clearance Items or Select Brands. Free Shaker and Samples promo is limit 1 per customer and while supplies last.""...nowhere there does it say ""you must check the green check box"" it only says that I need to spend $149....I also must say that I buy items from two other websites, which offer free items at certain dollar amounts. One has the following check box options ""I want my free stuff"" and ""I do not want my free stuff"". it will not let me checkout until I have checked one of the boxes. I must check a box.The other website has a popup if you do not choose your free item which says ""are you sure you don't want a free item?"".This website had nothing like this. My supplements arrived in a box which had room for the shaker, etc. so it would have been simple to add them in. Maybe a few ounces more.I also want to mention that I messaged with this one customer service rep and they never offered to send me the free items that I earned with my $149+ purchase. So I forwarded a copy of the Black Friday solicitation and showed them that there was no mention of this illusive checkbox. Just the requirement of spending $149+. You would think that I would have received a response, or maybe they would have just sent the free items? No. No response.Again, this company is great, has great items, great prices! But when you are offering a free item, just give the free item. Why make me check a box that I want a free item? How about a yes or no box? Or even simpler ""Check this box only if you DO NOT want the free item, otherwise you are getting the free item"". Seems that they would rather have this review than just giving me the free item that they said I would get with a $149+ purchase.I will be back next black friday, and I will NOT miss the check box. If all goes well, I will give a new and hopefully 5-star review. You guys deserve a better review, but the customer service for this black friday special is just falling very short of anything better. Make it right, and I will remove the review. If not, then see you next year.Date of experience: November 25, 2022",1,Pharma

Last batch was a vibrant canary yellow while this new batch looks like a banana about to go bad (both bottles).

I ordered a product that was on sale , and the web site had it listed as still being in stock. when I called they said it was sold out , and they were not sure they were getting anymore. So I was a little sad so they told me that if I wanted the product still then I would have to pay more which was a surprise to me I have never had that happen to me where the sale price wasn't honored. So I wanted the product so I payed the difference. They told me because I payed difference that they would throw a bunch of free samples in with my order. Guess what I did get any free samples. I'm going give them a 2nd chance , and hopefully it will be much better then the 1st.Date of experience: August 05, 2022",5,Pharma
